# 17. Complete grammar

<div id="171-notation-and-lexical-boundary" class="nucleus-source-anchor"></div>

## 17.1 Notation and lexical boundary

Quoted words and punctuation are terminals. Uppercase names are token categories from Chapter 3. Lowercase hyphenated names are nonterminals. `{ X }` means zero or more repetitions, `[ X ]` means optional, parentheses group alternatives, and `|` separates alternatives.

The lexical forms are:

```text
ascii-letter       ::= "A".."Z" | "a".."z"
decimal-digit      ::= "0".."9"
hexadecimal-digit  ::= decimal-digit | "A".."F" | "a".."f"
binary-digit       ::= "0" | "1"

identifier         ::= ascii-letter
                       { ascii-letter | decimal-digit | "_" }
integer-literal    ::= decimal-digit { decimal-digit }
                     | "$" hexadecimal-digit { hexadecimal-digit }
                     | "%" binary-digit { binary-digit }
character-literal  ::= "'" literal-byte "'"
string-literal     ::= '"' { literal-byte } '"'
escape             ::= "\\0" | "\\n" | "\\r" | "\\t"
                     | "\\'" | '\\"' | "\\\\"
                     | "\\x" hexadecimal-digit hexadecimal-digit
line-comment       ::= "//" { source-byte } (line-ending | EOF)
line-ending        ::= LF | CR LF
```

Sections 3.2 through 3.10 define `literal-byte`, accepted source bytes, maximal token formation, case-sensitive keyword and identifier recognition, numeric range, and lexical errors. Hexadecimal digits also occur in escapes, but an escape remains part of a character or string literal rather than an integer token.

The tokenizer emits `NAME`, `NUMBER`, `CHARACTER`, `STRING`, keyword and punctuation terminals, `NEWLINE`, and `EOF`. It emits `NEWLINE` only at delimiter depth zero, collapses blank or comment-only lines, and synthesizes a source-part-boundary or final logical newline when Sections 3.4 and 4.3 require one. Source-part events and metadata remain outside the token grammar. Those stateful rules are part of the token contract and are not context-free productions.

The grammar uses the general `expression` nonterminal for scalar constant leaves and type bounds. Chapter 8's constant-context predicate rejects variables, calls, nonconstant operations, and values outside the required range. The declared type and current aggregate component select a scalar expression, string literal, parenthesized record initializer, or bracketed array initializer. This type-directed choice resolves the shared opening `(` of a parenthesized scalar expression and a record initializer without backtracking. `type` permits at most one array suffix outside a bounded-string atom, which admits arrays of scalars, records, and bounded strings but not arrays of arrays.

## 17.3 Semantic predicates

The grammar uses these declared semantic predicates:

| Predicate                      | Decision                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isCallableName`               | At statement head, select a routine-call statement; in an expression, admit a call suffix only on a visible routine and retain its result and failure category.              |
| `isWritableName`               | At statement head, select assignment only when the resolved declaration is a mutable scalar or aggregate root; an aggregate constant root is rejected before suffix parsing. |
| `isRecordTypeName`             | Accept a `NAME` as a type atom only when it resolves to a visible record type.                                                                                               |
| `isInitializerForDeclaredType` | Select and check the scalar, string, positional record, recursive array, or zero-default rule from the declared variable, aggregate constant, or current component type.     |
| `isConstantContext`            | In constants, type bounds, array lengths, string capacities, and program initializers, admit only the compile-time operands and operations from Chapter 8.                   |
| `isIntegerConstantName`        | Admit a `NAME` as a counted-loop step magnitude only when it denotes an earlier `u8` or `u16` constant.                                                                      |
| `isIncompleteForwardName`      | Admit `sub NAME NEWLINE` as a body header only when the exact name resolves to one incomplete forward; install that forward's stored parameter bindings for the body.        |

Field lookup after `.` uses the selected record type, except that a bounded-string base admits only the intrinsic read-only suffix `.length`. Index selection uses a fixed-array domain or a bounded string's current logical length according to the base type; this distinction needs no grammar change. Static initializer checking descends the finite declared type tree and records the expected component before parsing each nested initializer. The `NAME` in `step-constant` must denote an earlier integer constant. A call suffix first produces a call expression with the visible signature's result and failure category. The checker then rejects a failable call unless an eligible initializer, assignment, or complete call statement immediately consumes that direct call under Chapter 14. A return source is always an ordinary successful expression and cannot contain a failable invocation. These are static semantic checks over an otherwise deterministic token stream, not token backtracking.

## 17.4 Predictive analysis

The repository grammar analyzer mechanically expanded the grammar above to 171 BNF rules over 94 nonterminals. It found no nullable-prefix left-recursion cycle, unreachable nonterminal, or unproductive nonterminal. The only predicate-resolved conflict sites are the name-led statement choice and the type-directed initializer choice. The focused test reads this Chapter 17 block directly, so the analyzer evidence does not create a second grammar authority.

| No unexplained FIRST/FIRST or FIRST/FOLLOW conflict remains. The expression repetitions expand to right-recursive analysis rules while their semantic actions preserve the left association specified in Section 9.6. Unary and `not` recursion remains right-recursive by design. `or` is exclusively the Boolean operator. A same-line `else fail` is selected only after a complete name-led statement or local initializer, while `else` at the start of the following logical line remains an `if` clause. The newline makes those cases deterministic without backtracking. The completed source before `else fail` must be exactly one direct failable invocation. Other reported conflicts require their named predicate or an audited equivalent; a compiler must report a specification defect rather than change the language silently. |

The analyzer result checks the collected grammar's formal shape. It does not prove the static compatibility, lifetime, capacity, or flow rules consolidated in Chapter 18.
