# Appendix 4 — Classic Z80 Instruction Support Table

This appendix is a **searchable support table** for the classic Z80 instruction
set.

It includes:

- the standard documented instruction families
- the classic undocumented forms most programmers still treat as part of the
  real Z80 machine model

It does **not** include:

- host-, firmware-, or emulator-specific `ED` aliases
- non-Z80 extensions from later or different CPUs
- cycle counts

Status values used below:

- `documented` — part of the standard documented Z80 set
- `documented prefix family` — standard, but lives in `CB`, `ED`, `DD`, `FD`,
  `DDCB`, or `FDCB`
- `undocumented but classic` — not in the original documented set, but widely
  supported and commonly treated as standard practice

## Notes On The Undocumented Forms Included Here

The undocumented forms included in this appendix are the ones most likely to be
treated by real Z80 programmers as part of the practical machine:

- `IXH`, `IXL`, `IYH`, `IYL` in many 8-bit `LD`, `INC`, `DEC`, and ALU forms
- `SLL` / `SLS`
- `DDCB` / `FDCB` indexed rotate/shift/bit-result-copy forms such as
  `rlc (ix+3),b`

These are exactly the sorts of forms that make a searchable appendix useful.
They are also exactly the forms that justify checking a table rather than
trusting your memory.

---

## Rotate and Shift Instructions in Detail

The Z80 has three families of rotate and shift instructions. The diagrams below
show exactly what happens to each bit on every operation.

---

### Circular rotates: RLC / RLCA and RRC / RRCA

The byte rotates as a closed ring. The bit that falls off one end wraps to the
other end, and a copy of it lands in the carry flag.

```
RLC / RLCA  (circular rotate left)
  before:  [b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0]   C = ?
  after:   [b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0 b7]   C = b7
  (bit 7 wraps to bit 0; C receives a copy of b7)

RRC / RRCA  (circular rotate right)
  before:  [b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0]   C = ?
  after:   [b0 b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1]   C = b0
  (bit 0 wraps to bit 7; C receives a copy of b0)
```

Nothing is lost in a circular rotate. All eight original bits are still present
in the result; they have just moved. C ends up equal to the bit that wrapped.

---

### Through-carry rotates: RL / RLA and RR / RRA

The carry flag acts as a ninth bit. The byte and the carry together form a
9-bit ring. The displaced bit exits through carry; the old carry enters on the
other side.

```
RL / RLA  (rotate left through carry)
  before:  [b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0]   C = c
  after:   [b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0  c]   C = b7
  (old C enters bit 0; bit 7 exits to new C)

RR / RRA  (rotate right through carry)
  before:  [b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0]   C = c
  after:   [ c b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1]   C = b0
  (old C enters bit 7; bit 0 exits to new C)
```

Nothing is lost here either. The old carry is the bit that entered. If you
rotate left through carry and then rotate right through carry, you recover the
original byte and the original carry. This makes RL/RR the right tool for
shifting multi-byte values: carry shuttles the overflow bit between adjacent
bytes.

---

### Shifts: SLA, SRA, SRL, SLL/SLS

Shifts do not wrap. The bit that falls off one end is lost after being copied
to carry. A fixed value fills the vacated position.

```
SLA  (shift left arithmetic)
  before:  [b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0]   C = ?
  after:   [b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0  0]   C = b7
  (0 fills bit 0; bit 7 exits to C; equivalent to multiply by 2)

SLL / SLS  (shift left logical, undocumented)
  before:  [b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0]   C = ?
  after:   [b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0  1]   C = b7
  (1 fills bit 0; bit 7 exits to C; result always has bit 0 set)

SRA  (shift right arithmetic)
  before:  [b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0]   C = ?
  after:   [b7 b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1]   C = b0
  (bit 7 preserved, copied into itself; bit 0 exits to C; signed divide by 2)

SRL  (shift right logical)
  before:  [b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0]   C = ?
  after:   [ 0 b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1]   C = b0
  (0 fills bit 7; bit 0 exits to C; unsigned divide by 2)
```

SRA and SRL differ in exactly one way: SRA copies bit 7 into itself, preserving
the sign. SRL clears bit 7. For signed values, SRA divides by 2 correctly —
−4 (= `$FC`) shifted right arithmetically gives −2 (= `$FE`). SRL would give
126 (= `$7E`), which is wrong for a signed interpretation.

---

### Accumulator forms vs CB-prefix forms

Every rotate instruction has two variants. The difference in which flags they
update is easy to miss.

| Form | Example | Flags updated |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Accumulator-only | `RLCA`, `RRCA`, `RLA`, `RRA` | C only |
| CB-prefix (any register) | `RLC r`, `RRC r`, `RL r`, `RR r` | S, Z, P/V, C |

`RLCA`, `RRCA`, `RLA`, and `RRA` are single-byte base instructions — fast and
compact. But they only update carry. S, Z, and P/V are left in their previous
state after them.

`RLC r`, `RRC r`, `RL r`, and `RR r` are CB-prefix forms. They rotate by the
same amount but update all four flags. If you need to test whether a register
is zero after a rotate — for example, to detect when all bits have been shifted
out — use the CB-prefix form, not the accumulator shorthand.

This is one of the Z80's genuine inconsistencies: two mnemonics that look like
the same operation but behave differently. The table entries above flag this
explicitly.

---

### Quick reference: what enters and exits each operation

| Instruction | Bit entering | From | Bit exiting | To |
|-------------|-------------|------|-------------|-----|
| RLC / RLCA | b7 | wraps from bit 7 | b7 copy | C |
| RL / RLA | old C | enters bit 0 | b7 | new C |
| RRC / RRCA | b0 | wraps from bit 0 | b0 copy | C |
| RR / RRA | old C | enters bit 7 | b0 | new C |
| SLA | 0 | fills bit 0 | b7 | C |
| SLL / SLS | 1 | fills bit 0 | b7 | C |
| SRA | b7 | preserved in place | b0 | C |
| SRL | 0 | fills bit 7 | b0 | C |
