# Chapter 8 — Stack and Subroutines

Every program you have written so far is a single block of instructions that runs from top to bottom. That works for small tasks. But larger programs need to reuse logic — the same comparison, the same output routine, the same byte-copying sequence — called from a dozen different places. Without a way to jump away and come back, you would copy those instructions everywhere you needed them and maintain every copy separately.

`call` and `ret` solve this. This chapter explains how they work, how the hardware stack supports them, and how to write subroutines that receive inputs through registers and hand results back to the caller.

---

## What a subroutine actually is

Before the mechanics: a useful mental model. The Z80 has no hardware concept of a function call. There is no special mode the CPU enters, no register tracking call depth, no difference between bytes at a call site and bytes inside a subroutine body. `call label` does two things — pushes an address, jumps. `ret` does one thing — pops that address back into PC. The subroutine abstraction is entirely a matter of discipline, not a hardware guarantee.

That matters because any failure of discipline — an unbalanced push/pop, a missing `ret`, a jump that skips the cleanup — produces a silent wrong result with nothing to indicate where it went wrong. The mechanics below are what make that discipline reliable.

---

## How `call` works

`call label` is a push of the return address followed by a jump — two operations
in one opcode. Concretely:

1. Pushes the address of the instruction following the `call` onto the hardware
   stack (this is the **return address**).
2. Jumps to `label`.

The instruction is always 3 bytes long, so the return address pushed is always
the address of the byte immediately after the `call` instruction.

The hardware stack is a region of RAM used as a last-in-first-out buffer. The
stack pointer SP always holds the address of the most recently pushed value.
When `call` pushes a word onto the stack, SP decreases by two (the stack grows
downward in memory on the Z80). The return address is stored at the new SP.

After the `call`, the CPU is executing instructions inside the subroutine. The
subroutine does not know which call site reached it.

---

## How `ret` works

`ret` is equivalent to `pop pc` — if such an instruction existed. The CPU reads
the top two bytes of the stack into the program counter, increments SP by two,
and execution resumes at the instruction after the original `call`.

If `ret` runs when the stack does not contain a valid return address — because
of a push/pop mismatch, for example — the CPU jumps to whatever bytes are at
the top of the stack, which is almost certainly not a valid instruction address.

---

## The hardware stack

The stack is a region of RAM. You decide where it lives by loading SP with a
starting address before the program uses any `call`, `push`, or `pop`
instructions. A common choice is the top of available RAM: `ld sp, $BFFF` (or
whichever address marks the last byte of RAM on your target).

The stack grows downward. Each push decreases SP by two and writes a 16-bit
value. Each pop reads two bytes and increases SP by two. The rule: SP always
points to the most recent data pushed.

A program that calls subroutines must have SP initialized to a valid address
before the first call. In ZAX's generic model, SP is assumed to be set up by the
loader or runtime before `main` is entered.

---

## Passing values through registers

The Z80 has no hardware-enforced calling convention. Any register can carry any
value into a subroutine or back out. The conventions used in these chapters
are:

- **A** carries a single byte result or input value.
- **HL** carries a 16-bit result or input value.
- **BC** and **DE** carry secondary input values.

The subroutine's comment block must document which registers it reads on entry
and which it modifies on exit. Without this documentation, the caller has no way
to know what registers are safe to use after the call.

Example documentation pattern:

```zax
; add_bytes: add two byte values.
; Inputs:  B = first byte, C = second byte
; Outputs: A = B + C
; Preserves: BC, DE, HL
func add_bytes(): AF
  ld a, b
  add a, c
end
```

The word `Preserves` means those registers hold the same values after the call
that they held before. The caller can rely on them being intact.

### The return clause tells ZAX which registers carry the result

A `func` declaration ends with a return clause that names the register or
registers that carry the result back to the caller. ZAX uses this to decide
which registers to save and restore around the function frame:

- **`func name()`** — no result; ZAX saves and restores AF, BC, DE, and HL.
  Any value placed in A inside the function is destroyed by the `pop AF`
  before `ret`.
- **`func name(): AF`** — A (and flags) hold the result; ZAX does NOT save or
  restore AF, so the value in A survives to the caller.
- **`func name(): HL`** — HL holds the result; AF, BC, and DE are saved and
  restored; HL is live on return.

### ZAX `func` blocks emit `ret` automatically

A ZAX `func` block does **not** require a final `ret`. When control reaches
`end`, the compiler emits the frame epilogue and `ret` automatically. Only use
`ret` inside a `func` for **early exits** — places in the function body where
you want to return before reaching `end`.

```zax
func my_sub(): AF
  ; ... compute result in A ...
  ; No explicit ret needed: ZAX emits ret at end.
end
```

>
> These two forms look similar but have different rules.
>
> **Raw labeled subroutine** — a block of instructions with a label at the top, called with `call label`. The assembler inserts nothing. You write every instruction, including the final `ret`. The return clause does not exist.

>   ld a, b
>   add a, c
>   ret              ; required — assembler will not add it for you

>
> **ZAX `func` block** — a named block opened with `func` and closed with `end`. ZAX emits register save/restore pushes and pops, and a final `ret`, automatically when it processes `end`. You do not write the closing `ret`.
>
> ```zax
> func my_zax_sub(): AF
>   ld a, b
>   add a, c
>   ; no ret needed here — ZAX emits it at end
> end
> ```
>
> The practical consequence: if you write a raw labeled subroutine and forget `ret`, the CPU will fall through into whatever bytes follow the last instruction — which is almost always wrong. If you write a ZAX `func` and add an extra `ret` at `end`, you have an unreachable instruction but no error. Use `ret` inside a `func` only for early exits — places where you want to return before reaching `end`.
>
> Chapter 10 uses raw labeled subroutines. Chapters 11–14 use ZAX `func` blocks exclusively.

Omitting the return clause when the function leaves a meaningful value in A is
a bug: the compiler's `pop AF` in the epilogue will overwrite A before
returning, and the caller sees stale flag values rather than the computed
result. If A carries the result, declare `: AF`.

---

## `push` and `pop`: saving and restoring registers

`push` and `pop` are most clearly described in terms of virtual `ld`
instructions.

`push hl`: SP is decremented by two, then the contents of HL are written to the two bytes at the new SP address — as if `ld (sp), hl` were an instruction. (`ld (sp), hl` is not an actual Z80 opcode, but that description captures the behaviour exactly.)

`pop hl` is the inverse: two bytes are read from the address in SP into HL, then SP is incremented by two — as if `ld hl, (sp)` were an instruction.

The operand can be any of AF, BC, DE, HL, IX, or IY. Every push writes two
bytes to RAM at SP; every pop reads them back. The stack tracks only position —
not what the bytes mean or where they came from. All register pairs are saved to the same area of
memory — the bytes at and below SP. The stack is the same RAM where your
program and variables reside.

A subroutine uses `push` / `pop` to preserve registers it needs to modify
internally. The pattern:

```zax
func example()
  push bc          ; save caller's BC on entry
  ; ... use BC for internal work ...
  pop bc           ; restore caller's BC before returning
end
```

The critical rule: every `push` in a subroutine must have exactly one matching
`pop` before the function returns. If a subroutine pushes twice and pops once,
the stack has an extra word on it when `ret` runs. `ret` will then read that
extra word as the return address and jump to garbage.

Stack depth discipline: count your pushes and pops. They must be balanced.

### Cross-register moves through the stack

The stack does not care which register pushed a value or which register pops it.
You can push one pair and pop into a different pair. This lets you perform
register transfers that `ld` cannot express:

```zax
  push af         ; save AF onto the stack
  push bc         ; save BC onto the stack
  pop de          ; DE ← what was in BC
  pop hl          ; HL ← what was in AF
```

After these four instructions, DE holds the original value of BC and HL holds
the original value of AF. The second transfer — AF into HL — is particularly
useful, because there is no `ld l, f` instruction. The flags register F cannot
appear in any `ld` combination, but it can be moved through the stack by
pushing AF and popping into another pair. This is one of the few ways to
inspect or transfer the flags register.

Remember that the stack is last-in-first-out: the pair pushed last is popped
first. If you swap the pop order above, DE gets AF and HL gets BC — the reverse
of what you might expect if you read the code top-to-bottom without thinking
about the stack.

---

## Shadow registers: saving state without the stack

In a tight interrupt handler or innermost loop, saving BC, DE, and HL via
`push` and `pop` costs six instructions — three pushes, three pops — and takes
six bytes of stack space. `exx` does the same job in a single instruction: it swaps
BC, DE, and HL with a second hidden set of registers (BC′, DE′, HL′)
simultaneously. A second instruction, `ex af, af′`, swaps A and F with their
shadow counterparts.

These are the **shadow registers** — a second, hidden copy of A, F, B, C, D,
E, H, and L. You cannot use them directly in instructions; `exx` and
`ex af, af′` are the only way in.

The trade-off is that there is only one shadow set. If both your main code and
an interrupt handler rely on `exx`, the interrupt can silently destroy the
values the main code stored. `push` and `pop` work at any nesting depth; shadow
registers do not. Use them when speed matters and you can guarantee that only
one context uses them at a time.

---

## Conditional return: `ret cc`

The Z80 also provides conditional return instructions: `ret z`, `ret nz`,
`ret c`, `ret nc`, and so on. `ret z` pops the return address and returns only
if Z is set; otherwise it falls through to the next instruction.

This is useful for early-exit patterns:

```zax
func check_nonzero()
  or a          ; test A for zero
  ret z         ; early exit: return immediately if A is zero
  ; ... rest of the function runs only when A != 0 ...
  ; No explicit ret needed at the end: ZAX emits it automatically.
end
```

`ret z` here is an **early exit** — it returns before `end` is reached.
ZAX still emits the epilogue and final `ret` at `end` for the normal path.

When using `ret cc`, the stack must be balanced at the conditional return point
just as it must be at the final return. If the function pushed a register before
the test, it must pop before `ret z` as well.

---

## Nested calls and stack depth

A subroutine can itself call another subroutine. Each `call` pushes another
return address; each `ret` pops one. As long as every call is matched with a
return, the stack remains balanced and execution returns correctly through each
level.

The only limit is the size of the RAM region allocated to the stack. A program
that calls too many levels deep — or forgets to pop before returning — will
overwrite RAM used for other purposes. The Z80 has no hardware guard against
stack overflow.

---

## The example: `learning/part1/examples/06_subroutines.zax`

```zax
section data vars at $8000
  result_add:  byte = 0
  result_max:  word = 0
end
```

The program has a `main` function and two helper subroutines.

**`add_bytes`: the simplest subroutine.**

```zax
func add_bytes(): AF
  ld a, b
  add a, c
end
```

`add_bytes` reads B and C, adds them, and leaves the result in A. The return
clause `: AF` tells ZAX that A carries the result, so AF is not saved and
restored — the computed sum in A reaches the caller intact. It modifies only A,
so BC, DE, and HL are naturally preserved. The caller (`main`) passes 20 in B
and 10 in C:

```zax
ld b, $14
ld c, $0A
call add_bytes        ; A = 30
ld (result_add), a
```

After the call, `result_add` holds 30 (`$1E`).

**`max_word`: push/pop for preservation.**

```zax
func max_word(): HL
  push de
  or a
  sbc hl, de
  pop de
  jr c, max_is_de
  add hl, de
  ret                ; early exit: HL holds the original HL (the larger value)
max_is_de:
  ex de, hl          ; HL < DE: put DE (the larger value) into HL
end
```

`max_word` receives two 16-bit values in HL and DE and returns the larger one in
HL. Because it returns a result in HL, its declaration is `func max_word(): HL`.
ZAX saves and restores AF, BC, and DE, but leaves HL live for the caller.

Internally the function uses `sbc hl, de` to compare HL with DE, which
overwrites HL. The original DE value is needed after the subtraction (to put
back into HL if DE was larger), so it is saved with `push de` at entry and
restored with `pop de` immediately after the subtract.

The `or a` before `sbc hl, de` clears the carry flag. `sbc hl, de` subtracts
DE from HL including the carry bit, so carry must be clear before the
instruction for a pure 16-bit subtraction.

After `sbc hl, de`, the carry flag indicates the comparison result:

- **Carry clear** — HL was greater than or equal to DE (no unsigned borrow).
  HL now holds `original_HL - DE`, which is not the result we want. `add hl, de`
  restores HL to its original value, and the function returns with that value.
- **Carry set** — HL was less than DE (unsigned borrow occurred). DE is the
  larger value. `ex de, hl` puts DE into HL and returns.

The `or a / sbc hl, de / add hl, de` sequence is how you do an unsigned 16-bit
comparison when you need the original HL back after the test. `sbc hl, de` is
destructive; `add hl, de` undoes the subtraction when HL was the larger value.

The caller passes 80 (`$0050`) in HL and 200 (`$00C8`) in DE:

```zax
ld hl, $0050
ld de, $00C8
call max_word         ; HL = $00C8
ld (result_max), hl
```

After the call, `result_max` holds 200.

**Stack balance in `max_word`.** The function has one `push de` and one `pop de`.
The pop occurs before `jr c, max_is_de`, which means DE is restored regardless
of which branch the conditional takes. The stack is clean for both `ret`
paths.

---

## An advanced trick: reading the program counter

The Z80 has no instruction to read PC directly. But because `call` pushes the
address of the next instruction onto the stack, you can read PC with a trick:

```zax
  call next_instr       ; pushes address of next_instr onto the stack
next_instr:
  pop hl                ; HL = address of this instruction
```

`call next_instr` jumps to the very next instruction — it does nothing except
push the return address. `pop hl` retrieves that address. HL now holds its own
address in memory, which is the value PC had when `pop hl` was fetched.

There is no `ret` here, and that is fine. The only thing the stack requires is
balance: `call` pushed one word, `pop hl` consumed it. The stack is clean.
This trick demonstrates the freedom assembly gives you: `call` and `ret` are
not ceremonial pairs that must always appear together. They are stack
operations, and you can use them however the stack discipline permits.

---

## Summary

- `call label` pushes the return address onto the stack and jumps to `label`.
- `ret` pops the return address and jumps to it, returning to the call site.
- The hardware stack is a region of RAM. SP points to the most recently pushed
  word; the stack grows downward.
- Pass values into a subroutine in registers: A for a single byte, HL for a
  16-bit word, BC and DE for secondary values. Document which registers carry
  inputs and which carry outputs.
- `push rr` saves a register pair; `pop rr` restores it. Every push must have
  a matching pop before the function returns.
- Unbalanced push/pop causes `ret` to jump to garbage, because the wrong bytes
  are at the top of the stack when `ret` reads the return address.
- `ret cc` returns conditionally; the stack must be balanced at that point too.
- The shadow registers (A′–L′) provide one-instruction save/restore via `exx`
  and `ex af, af′`, but only one context can use them safely at a time.
- Subroutines can call other subroutines. Each call pushes a return address;
  each ret pops one. The stack depth grows with each nested call.
- A ZAX `func` block emits the cleanup and `ret` automatically at `end`. A
  trailing `ret` is not needed. Use `ret` inside a `func` only for early exits.
  Raw labeled subroutines — code reached by `call label` outside a ZAX `func`
  — are plain Z80 and do require an explicit `ret`.

---

## What Comes Next

Every program so far has been self-contained — loads constants, processes data in memory, stores a result. Chapter 9 breaks that boundary. The Z80 has a separate address space for hardware peripherals, and two instructions — `in` and `out` — are the only way to cross it. The subroutine structure you have just learned is exactly what peripheral drivers are built from.

---

## Exercises

**1. Stack trace.** Work through these four instructions by hand, tracking the stack and register values at each step. Assume SP starts at `$C000` and that the values in the registers before the sequence are: AF = `$1234`, BC = `$5678`.

```zax
push af
push bc
pop de
pop hl
```

After all four instructions: what is in DE? What is in HL? What is SP? _(Remember: the stack is last-in-first-out — the pair pushed last is the first to be popped.)_

**2. Spot the push/pop mismatch.** This subroutine has a stack-balance bug. Identify it and explain precisely what will happen when `ret` executes:

```zax
func count_nonzero(): AF
  push bc
  push de
  ld b, $08
  ld c, 0
count_loop:
  ld a, (hl)
  or a
  jr z, skip
  inc c
skip:
  inc hl
  djnz count_loop
  ld a, c
  pop bc
end
```

Write the corrected version.

**3. Write a subroutine.** Write a ZAX `func` called `double_byte` that receives a byte value in B and returns B × 2 in A. The function should use the `: AF` return clause so that A reaches the caller intact. Then write the three lines of `main` that pass the value 15 to the function, call it, and store the result in a variable named `doubled`.

**4. The `or a / sbc hl, de` pattern.** The `max_word` subroutine in the chapter uses `or a` immediately before `sbc hl, de`. Explain what `or a` does to the carry flag and why omitting it would produce wrong results. Then explain the `add hl, de` that follows on the carry-clear path — why is it needed, and what does HL hold after `sbc hl, de` on that path?
