# Chapter 11 — Functions and the IX Frame

Chapter 8 showed that `call` is just a `push` of the return address followed by a `jp`, and `ret` is just a `pop` of that address back into PC. You passed arguments in registers, documented the convention in a comment, and hoped every caller got the convention right. This works. It works right up to the point where you run out of registers, or forget which register carries what, or change a function's inputs and miss one of the twelve callers.

This chapter introduces ZAX functions — the first feature in this book that is not raw Z80 assembly. A ZAX function declares its parameters and locals by name. The compiler builds a **stack frame** using IX as a base pointer, and you access every parameter and local through standard Z80 `ld` instructions with IX-relative offsets. No new syntax inside the function body. Just `ld a, (ix+name+0)` — the same displaced addressing you learned in Chapter 7.

The companion example is `learning/part1/examples/09_typed_storage.zax`.

## Why register passing runs out

Consider a subroutine that scans a byte table and returns the largest value. Chapter 8's version passed the table pointer in HL and the count in B:

```zax
; find_max: scan a byte table, return largest value.
; Inputs:  HL = pointer to first byte, B = count
; Outputs: A = maximum
```

Two parameters, two registers. Now add a third parameter — a threshold value:

```zax
; count_above: count bytes strictly above a threshold.
; Inputs:  HL = pointer, B = count, C = threshold
; Outputs: A = count
```

Three parameters, three registers. And inside `count_above`, the running count has to live somewhere too — that was D. Four values, four registers. You are already running low, and neither function does anything complicated.

The problem compounds when functions call other functions. If `main` calls `find_max` and then `count_above`, it has to reload HL before the second call because `find_max` walked HL to the end of the table. The only way to know this is to read `find_max`'s body — the function signature says nothing about side effects.

Raw register passing does not scale. It works for small programs where you can hold the entire register map in your head. Beyond that, you need a systematic way to pass values.

## The stack frame

A stack frame is a region of the stack that belongs to one function call. It holds that function's parameters — placed there by the caller before the call — and any local variables the function needs while it runs. When the function returns, the frame is gone. The next call builds a new one.

The solution is the same one that nearly every CPU architecture uses: dedicate a register as a **base pointer** into the stack, and place parameters and local variables at known offsets from that pointer.

On the Z80, that register is IX. When a ZAX function with parameters or locals is called, the compiler emits a three-instruction prologue:

```asm
push ix          ; save the caller's IX
ld   ix, 0
add  ix, sp      ; IX = current stack pointer
```

After the prologue, IX points to the base of the frame. Parameters — which the caller pushed onto the stack before the `call` — sit at positive offsets from IX. Local variables sit at negative offsets. The compiler knows the exact offset of every named value.

At function exit, the compiler emits the matching epilogue:

```asm
ld  sp, ix       ; discard locals
pop ix           ; restore caller's IX
ret
```

Six instructions of overhead — three in, three out — plus any register saves. A raw `call` and `ret` are two instructions with no frame at all. The frame is not free.

### What the frame looks like in memory

A picture makes the offsets concrete. Consider this function:

```zax
func find_max_f(tbl: addr, len: byte): AF
  var
    running_max: byte = 0
  end
  ...
end
```

Called with `tbl = $8010` and `len = 8`. Here is the stack at the moment the function body begins to execute, with IX pointing at the frame base:

```
  high address
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  tbl  high byte = $80          address: IX+7            │ ← (ix+tbl+1)
  │  tbl  low byte  = $10          address: IX+6            │ ← (ix+tbl+0)
  │  len  high byte = $00          address: IX+5  (unused)  │
  │  len  low byte  = $08          address: IX+4            │ ← (ix+len+0)
  │  return address high byte      address: IX+3            │
  │  return address low  byte      address: IX+2            │
  │  saved IX high byte            address: IX+1            │
  │  saved IX low  byte            address: IX+0  ← IX      │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  IX = frame base
  │  running_max low  byte = $00   address: IX-1            │ ← (ix+running_max+0)
  │  running_max high byte = $00   address: IX-2            │
  │  ... register saves ...                                 │
  │  SP →                                                   │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  low address
```

A few things to read from this diagram:

**Parameters are above IX** (positive offsets). The caller pushed them before the `call`. Each parameter gets a 16-bit slot on the stack regardless of its declared type — the Z80's `push` instruction always writes two bytes. A `byte` parameter puts its value in the low byte of the slot; the high byte is zero and unused.

**Locals are below IX** (negative offsets). The compiler pushes them as part of the prologue, so they appear below the saved IX on the stack. `running_max` is at IX−1 (low byte). You access it with `(ix+running_max+0)`, where the compiler resolves `running_max` to the displacement `−1`.

**The `+0` / `+1` suffix selects the byte lane.** For `tbl`, `+0` gives the low byte at IX+6 and `+1` gives the high byte at IX+7. This is the same little-endian convention the Z80 uses everywhere: low byte at the lower address. For a `byte` parameter like `len`, only `+0` is meaningful — the high byte at `+1` is always zero.

**IX+0 through IX+3 are bookkeeping.** IX+0–1 is the saved IX you must restore on exit; IX+2–3 is the return address that `ret` will pop. You do not read or write these directly. The compiler's epilogue handles them.

This layout is the same for every framed ZAX function — only the number of parameter slots and local slots changes. For a tight inner loop calling a tiny helper, the overhead may matter. For a function called a handful of times from a larger program, the cost is small relative to what the function actually does, and the gain in clarity is real.

Chapter 7 used IX as a base for table access: point IX at a structure, then read with `(ix+d)`. Inside a framed ZAX function, IX holds the **frame** base. The same addressing mode now serves the frame — each `(ix+d)` names a parameter or local slot. If you load a new address into IX to walk a second table, you overwrite the frame pointer; every later `(ix+…)` reads the wrong place, and the bug is silent. For that second structure, use **IY** — same index addressing as IX, and ZAX does not use IY for the frame. If you must use IX for the table, `push ix` before the indexed work and `pop ix` before any further frame access; IY is usually simpler. The prologue's `push ix` also covers the caller: they may have been using IX for their own `(ix+d)` access, so you save their IX, take IX for the frame, and restore it at exit.

IXH and IXL are the high and low bytes of IX (Chapter 3). Using IXH or IXL as scratch inside a framed function corrupts the frame pointer. IYH and IYL stay free unless you deliberately use IY for indexing.

---

## Declaring a function with parameters

Here is the `find_max` subroutine rewritten as a ZAX function with typed parameters:

```zax
func find_max_f(tbl: addr, len: byte): AF
  var
    running_max: byte = 0
  end

  ; load parameters into registers using raw IX access
  ld l, (ix+tbl+0)              ; low byte of tbl
  ld h, (ix+tbl+1)              ; high byte of tbl
  ld b, (ix+len+0)              ; len is a byte — just one load

find_max_loop:
  ld a, (hl)
  cp (ix+running_max+0)
  jr c, find_max_skip
  ld (ix+running_max+0), a      ; new maximum
find_max_skip:
  inc hl
  djnz find_max_loop

  ld a, (ix+running_max+0)      ; return result in A
end
```

The comment block is gone — the parameter names `tbl` and `len` say what the function expects. The local `running_max` says what it holds. And every access is a standard Z80 `ld` instruction with an IX-relative offset. The compiler resolves `(ix+tbl+0)` to the correct numeric displacement. You never count stack slots by hand.

`tbl: addr` is a 16-bit address parameter — it occupies a two-byte frame slot. To load it into HL you need two byte-wide loads: `(ix+tbl+0)` for the low byte into L, `(ix+tbl+1)` for the high byte into H.

`len: byte` is a one-byte parameter, but it still occupies a 16-bit slot on the stack. The Z80's `push` instruction always writes a full register pair — there is no single-byte push — so every argument takes two bytes of stack space regardless of its declared type. Only the low byte carries the value: `(ix+len+0)` is all you need.

`running_max: byte = 0` is a local variable initialized to zero. It sits at a negative offset from IX. You read it with `ld a, (ix+running_max+0)` and write it with `ld (ix+running_max+0), a`.

The `+0` and `+1` suffixes select which byte of a slot you want. For a byte-sized value, `+0` is the only one you use. For a word-sized value, `+0` is the low byte and `+1` is the high byte — little-endian, as always on the Z80.

---

## Calling a function

The caller names the arguments directly:

```zax
find_max_f values, TableLen
```

The compiler emits the pushes for `values` and `TableLen`, the `call`, and the stack cleanup after return. You do not load HL or B yourself. The compiler matches each argument to its parameter, checks types, and generates the call sequence.

After the call returns, you read the result from whichever register the function declared:

```zax
find_max_f values, TableLen
ld (max_val), a                  ; result is in A (declared : AF)
```

No register pre-loading. No comments explaining which register holds what.

---

## The return clause

The return clause controls which registers carry the result and which ones the compiler saves and restores:

| Declaration    | Meaning                               | Compiler preserves                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `func f()`     | No return value                       | AF, BC, DE, HL all saved/restored |
| `func f(): AF` | A carries the result                  | BC, DE, HL saved; AF is not       |
| `func f(): HL` | Typed return in HL (byte in L, H = 0) | AF, BC, DE saved; HL is not       |

`: AF` removes AF from the save/restore set, so whatever value A holds at function exit survives into the caller. This is the same convention from Chapter 8 — caller and callee agree that A carries the result. The declaration tells the compiler not to clobber it with a `pop AF` in the epilogue.

`: HL` is the typed return: byte values go in L (H zeroed), word values fill all of HL.

Omitting the return clause when the function leaves a meaningful value in A is a bug. The compiler's `pop AF` in the epilogue will overwrite A before the caller sees it. Declare `: AF` to prevent this.

## Raw access vs the `:=` operator

Everything in this chapter uses raw Z80 instructions to access frame slots. You write `ld a, (ix+running_max+0)` and the compiler resolves the name to an offset. This is deliberate: you already know IX-relative addressing from Chapter 7. The frame is just a structured use of what you already learned.

ZAX also provides a typed assignment operator — `:=` — that handles frame access at a higher level. It picks the right registers, handles word-sized slots that need multi-instruction sequences, and checks types. Chapter 13 covers `:=` in full. You will have written the raw version by hand by then, so you will know exactly what it generates.

---

## A second function: count_above

```zax
func count_above_f(tbl: addr, len: byte, threshold: byte): AF
  var
    cnt: byte = 0
  end

  ld l, (ix+tbl+0)
  ld h, (ix+tbl+1)
  ld b, (ix+len+0)

count_loop:
  ld a, (hl)
  cp (ix+threshold+0)
  jr c, count_skip               ; A < threshold: skip
  jr z, count_skip               ; A = threshold: skip (strictly above)
  ld a, (ix+cnt+0)
  inc a
  ld (ix+cnt+0), a               ; cnt = cnt + 1
count_skip:
  inc hl
  djnz count_loop

  ld a, (ix+cnt+0)               ; return count in A
end
```

Three parameters and one local — four named values, each at its own IX-relative offset. In raw Z80, this function needed four registers (HL, B, C, D) and a `push bc / ld d, 0 / pop bc` dance just to initialize the counter without disturbing the inputs. Here, `cnt` has its own frame slot. No juggling.

`cp (ix+threshold+0)` compares A directly against the frame slot. You do not have to load the threshold into a register first — `cp` accepts `(IX+d)` as its operand. This frees C, which the raw version had tied up holding the threshold.

---

## Frameless vs framed

Not every function pays the frame cost. A function with no parameters and no `var` block is **frameless**. The compiler emits no prologue and no epilogue — just the instructions you wrote, with a `ret` at the end. Every function before this chapter was frameless. With no frame, IX is free — you can use IX and IY for Chapter 7-style indexing, and IXH, IXL, IYH, and IYL as byte-sized scratch registers the same way as in Chapter 3.

The frame exists only to support named parameters and locals. If you do not need them — because the function is short enough that register passing works fine — skip the declaration and write a raw subroutine. The frame is a tool, not a tax.

---

## Summary

- A ZAX `func` with parameters or locals gets a stack frame. IX is the base pointer.
- The compiler emits a three-instruction prologue and epilogue. Frameless functions (no params, no locals) have none of this overhead.
- Parameters sit at positive IX offsets; locals sit at negative offsets.
- You access both with standard Z80 instructions: `ld a, (ix+name+0)` for a byte, `(ix+name+0)` / `(ix+name+1)` for the low/high bytes of a word.
- The `+0` / `+1` suffix selects the byte lane within a slot.
- The caller names arguments in the call; the compiler emits the pushes and cleanup.
- The return clause (`: AF`, `: HL`, or omitted) controls which registers survive and which the compiler preserves.
- Inside a framed function, IX is the frame pointer. IXH and IXL are reserved with it; IYH/IYL stay free unless you use IY for indexing. Frameless functions leave IX free for indexing and all four half-index registers for scratch.
- Chapter 13 introduces `:=`, which automates the frame access you wrote by hand here. By then you will know what it generates.

## Exercises

**1. Calculate the frame offsets.** Given this function declaration:

```zax
func process(src: addr, count: byte, limit: byte): AF
  var
    total: word = 0
    flags: byte = 0
  end
  ...
end
```

Draw the stack layout diagram at the start of the function body (after the prologue). For each parameter and local, state its IX offset and whether you would access it with `+0` only or `+0`/`+1`. _(Hint: parameters are pushed right-to-left in call order, so the first argument ends up at the highest positive offset.)_

**2. The IXH/IXL trap.** A framed function contains this sequence:

```zax
func compute(n: byte): AF
  var result: byte = 0 end
  ld ixh, 0          ; bug: why?
  ld b, (ix+n+0)
  ...
end
```

Explain exactly why `ld ixh, 0` is a bug in this context. What does IX contain at this point in the function, and what does zeroing the high byte of IX do to the frame?

**3. Frameless vs framed.** Look at this pair of functions:

```zax
func double(): AF      ; no parameters, no var block
  ld a, b
  add a, a
end

func scale(val: byte, factor: byte): AF
  var result: byte = 0 end
  ...
end
```

Which function has a frame? Which is frameless? For the frameless one, what is the total overhead in number of extra instructions the compiler emits before and after the body? For the framed one, can you safely use IX for table access inside the body without extra precautions? Why or why not?

**4. Spot the missing lane.** The following `addr` parameter load is incomplete:

```zax
func copy_table(src: addr, dst: addr, len: byte): AF
  ...
  ld h, (ix+src+1)    ; only loads high byte
  ld b, (ix+len+0)
  ; now tries to use HL as the source address
  ld a, (hl)
  ...
end
```

What value does L hold at the point of `ld a, (hl)`? What address does HL now point to? Write the corrected version.
