# Chapter 9 — Gaps and Futures

`eight_queens.zax` is the final example in the course. It solves the eight-queens
puzzle — placing eight queens on a chessboard so that none threatens any other —
by recursive backtracking. It is not the most complex algorithm in this course;
`bst.zax` has a more intricate data structure, and `rpn_calculator.zax` has more
moving parts. What makes `eight_queens.zax` the right capstone is its
control-flow pressure. It is a backtracking search, and backtracking search puts
maximum stress on the loop escape surface: the algorithm wants to stop searching
the moment a solution is found, and it wants to skip quickly past invalid
positions. Without good loop escape primitives, backtracking search accumulates
manual state.

This chapter reads `eight_queens.zax` as a lens on the current ZAX surface —
what it expresses cleanly and where it still requires workarounds — and connects
those observations to the language's recorded friction and its ongoing design
work.

## The Eight Queens Algorithm

The algorithm assigns one queen to each row, trying each column in turn. For each
row, `place_row` iterates over the eight column positions and checks three
constraints: the column must not already be occupied, the forward diagonal must
not already be threatened, and the backward diagonal must not already be
threatened. Column occupation is tracked in `col_used`, a byte array indexed by
column number. The two diagonals are tracked in `diag_sum_used` and
`diag_diff_used`, indexed by `row + col` and `row + col - DiagBias` respectively.
The `DiagBias` constant shifts the difference index into the non-negative range.

When all three constraint arrays say the position is free, `place_row` marks the
position, records the column assignment in `queen_cols`, and recurses into
`place_row row + 1`. When the recursion reaches row 8 — one past the last row —
all eight queens have been placed and the solution is found. The function sets
`found_solution := 1` and returns. On unwind, each level of recursion checks
`found_solution` and returns immediately if it is set, propagating the termination
back to the root call.

---

## `break` and `continue` in Practice

The column loop in `place_row` uses both `break` and `continue` (introduced in
Chapter 02, `prime_sieve.zax`):

```zax
    l := col_index
    a := col_used[L]
    or a
    if NZ
      step col_index
      ld a, 1
      or a
      continue
    end
```

When a constraint check fails, the column index is advanced with `step col_index`
and `continue` jumps to the loop test, skipping the remaining checks and the
placement code. There are three such constraint checks, each ending with
`continue`. At the bottom of the loop, if all constraints passed and the recursive
call returned with `found_solution` set, `break` exits the loop immediately:

```zax
    a := found_solution
    or a
    if NZ
      break
    end
```

(From `learning/part2/examples/unit9/eight_queens.zax`, lines 109–113.)

Before `break` and `continue` were part of the ZAX surface, the friction log
records that the workaround for this kind of control flow was explicit state
variables and early returns. The `found_solution` flag is still necessary —
because `break` exits only the innermost loop, not the entire recursive call
chain — but the constraint-check skips use `continue` cleanly rather than
nesting `if/else` blocks or duplicating the loop increment.

Structured loop escape — `break` and `continue` — was the highest-priority
language gap identified during the course. Both are now implemented. The
`eight_queens.zax` example uses `continue` in the constraint checks and `break`
after finding a solution.

---

## Where the Workaround Remains Visible

The `found_solution` flag is explicit module state. Every level of recursion
checks it on entry and again after the recursive call returns. This is correct,
but it is a workaround: the flag exists because `break` exits a loop, not a
recursive call stack. Once `place_row` has recursed eight levels deep and found
a solution, there is no structured way to unwind all eight frames at once.
Instead, the found flag propagates back through each return, one frame at a
time.

`break` and `continue` in nested loops work correctly — they target the
immediately enclosing loop, the same rule as C. The gap here is specifically
about recursive call chains: early termination inside recursion still requires
manual flag propagation. No structured alternative has been designed yet.

---

## The Friction Log in Full

Working through the course examples surfaced the following gaps.

**Already addressed**: Structured loop escape — `break` and `continue` — was
the highest-priority gap identified from `eight_queens.zax` and the broader
course. It is now implemented. The course examples use it.

**Design open**:

- _Propagating termination across recursive call frames._ The `found_solution`
  flag in `eight_queens.zax` is a workaround for this. `break` exits the
  immediately enclosing loop — the same rule as C, and it works correctly in
  nested loops without any labels. The gap here is different: when the algorithm
  wants to stop a recursion from inside a deeply nested frame, it must propagate
  a result through every frame on the call stack. In `eight_queens.zax` that
  mechanism is a module-level flag that every recursive level checks on return.
  No structured alternative exists yet; the gap is recorded and the design is
  open.

- _Typed dereference annotation._ `bst.zax` still uses `<Type>local.field` at
  each traversal step when the cursor is an `addr` local. The linked list
  example uses a record-typed local (`current_ptr: ListNode`) so field access
  does not repeat the cast; `addr` itself still carries no type information.
  General ergonomics for pointer-heavy code remain an open design area.

- _Software-stack storage verbosity._ `rpn_calculator.zax` requires storing
  every `pop_word` result into a local immediately to survive the next
  `pop_word`. The support module interface works, but the interaction between
  software-stack operations and frame-local storage is repetitive. Whether the
  answer is a library surface change or a language feature is not yet clear.

**Language gaps, not library gaps**:

- _Local named-constant initialisation._ `var` block initialisers cannot
  currently reference named constants by name. This is a readability gap
  grounded in `binary_search.zax` and `bubble_sort.zax`. It requires a
  compiler change and cannot be worked around in a library.

---

## Summary

- `break` and `continue` are implemented and available on the current surface.
  The eight-queens column loop shows both in a single algorithm: `continue`
  skips failed constraint checks cleanly; `break` exits on a found solution.
- An explicit flag variable is still the necessary mechanism for propagating a
  found result across recursive frames. `break` exits the immediately enclosing
  loop and works correctly in nested loops — the same rule as C. The open gap
  is about propagating early termination across a recursive call stack, which
  requires explicit shared state until a structural mechanism exists.
- The `<Type>local.field` repetition from Chapter 08 and the `pop_word`/`stack_depth`
  bouncing from Chapter 07 are both known design issues. See `docs/design/` for
  current work.
- The `.z80` output is deterministic and inspectable throughout. The compiler
  adds no hidden passes or runtime system. That design position is deliberate
  and unchanged.

## Exercises

1. `place_row` uses three separate `continue` statements to skip failed
   constraint checks. Each one advances `col_index` with `step` and
   re-establishes NZ before jumping to the loop test. What would happen if the
   `step col_index` were omitted from one of the three `continue` paths? Trace
   the column loop behaviour for a column that fails the first constraint check.

2. The `found_solution` flag is module-level state. `main` resets it to zero
   before calling `place_row`. What happens if that reset is removed and `main`
   is called twice in sequence? Trace the second call's behaviour from the entry
   of `place_row` when `found_solution` is already 1.

3. `place_row` marks the three constraint arrays (`col_used`, `diag_sum_used`,
   `diag_diff_used`) before recursing and unmarks them on backtrack. If the
   marking step runs but the unmark step is skipped — say, the function returns
   early before reaching the unmark — what happens to the search for later
   columns on the same row? Identify the specific code path where this could
   occur.

4. The eight-queens solution terminates as soon as one solution is found.
   Modify `place_row` to count all solutions rather than stopping at the first.
   What changes in the termination condition, the flag variable, and the
   `found_solution` check after the recursive call?

## Where the Course Ends

You still choose registers, write mnemonics, manage flags, and decide what lives
in ROM versus RAM. The compiler adds names, typed offsets, function frames, and
structured control flow. The `.z80` output is deterministic: every source line
maps to a predictable instruction sequence that you can read and verify.

The course started by showing you ten bytes of raw machine code at address
`$0000`. It ends with a recursive backtracking search that places eight queens
on a chessboard, uses typed locals and named parameters, and escapes its inner
loop with `break` and `continue`. The same Z80 instructions are underneath
every line. Nothing is hidden that you have not already seen.

The gaps in this chapter are genuine — they are the places where the current
surface still requires manual workarounds and the design is not finished. That
is an honest position for a real tool. `eight_queens.zax` compiles, runs, and
finds a solution. The `found_solution` flag is the workaround; `break` and
`continue` are the progress. Both show up in the same file.

The next step is yours. Take a problem that matters to you — something that
runs on constrained hardware, or benefits from knowing exactly what the machine
is doing — and write it in ZAX. The gaps will surface where they matter for
that specific program. The tools to address them are the raw Z80 instructions
you already know how to use.
