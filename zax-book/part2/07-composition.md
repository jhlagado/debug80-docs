# Chapter 7 — Composition

Every program so far in this course has been a single file. This chapter introduces the first program that is not: an RPN calculator split across two source files. `rpn_calculator.zax` is the calculator itself. `word_stack.zax` is a separate module that the calculator imports — it provides push and pop over a typed word array, and the calculator uses these operations without caring how they are implemented.

The separation is small but representative. It shows how ZAX `import` works, how a module-qualified call is written, and how a well-chosen interface lets the higher-level algorithm stay focused on what it is computing rather than how the stack is maintained.

---

## The RPN Stack Machine

Reverse Polish notation evaluates an expression written as a sequence of tokens
where operators follow their operands. The expression `7 3 + 2 *` means "push 7,
push 3, add the top two values (giving 10), push 2, multiply the top two values
(giving 20)." There is no operator precedence to track, no parentheses, and no
ambiguity: the stack is the only state.

This makes RPN a natural fit for a software-stack implementation. The evaluator
scans tokens left to right, maintaining a stack of pending word values. Number
tokens push their value. Operator tokens pop two operands, apply the operation,
and push the result. When the token stream is exhausted, the stack holds exactly
one value: the answer.

`rpn_calculator.zax` implements this evaluation loop directly. The token stream
is two parallel arrays — `token_kinds` and `token_values` — both declared at
module scope. The software stack is a `word[8]` array named `value_stack`, also
at module scope, with a separate `stack_depth` byte tracking how many valid
elements it contains. This is a deliberate design: the stack storage is module
state, not function-local, because it needs to persist across the helper calls
that `push_word` and `pop_word` make. The calculator function manages the depth
counter itself; the helper functions read and write through it.

---

## The `import` Mechanism

The first line of `rpn_calculator.zax` is:

```zax
import "word_stack.zax"
```

This makes the exported functions from `word_stack.zax` available under the
module qualifier `word_stack`. A call to `push_word` from the calculator is
written as:

```zax
word_stack.push_word value_stack, stack_depth, hl
stack_depth := a
```

The qualifier makes the call site explicit about where the operation comes from.
`push_word` returns in A: it yields the new depth count. The `stack_depth := a`
that follows every stack operation captures that return value into the module
variable. No hidden state, no mutable counter inside the support module — just
two functions that accept the storage and the current depth as arguments and
return the updated depth.

---

## `include`: text insertion

`import` compiles a separate module and makes its exported names available under
a module qualifier. `include` does something simpler: it inserts the text of
another file at the point where `include` appears, exactly as if you had typed
that file's contents there yourself.

```zax
include "constants.zax"
```

There is no module qualifier, no separate compilation, and no namespace boundary.
Any `const`, `enum`, `type`, or `op` declaration in the included file lands
directly in the including file's namespace. If `constants.zax` defines
`const MaxLen = 64`, then `MaxLen` is available without any qualifier after the
`include`.

**When to use each:**

Use `import` when you are pulling in a module with its own functions and data —
a library, a support module, anything that has its own identity. The module
qualifier makes the origin of every function call explicit at the call site.

Use `include` when you are sharing definitions that logically belong to every
file that uses them: constants, type declarations, `op` macro libraries, shared
enums. These have no functions to qualify; they are just names that all files
need to know. An `include` of a constants file is closer to a C header than to
a C `#include` of a `.c` source file — it brings in declarations, not
implementations.

**Caution:** `include` has no circular-detection. If file A includes file B and
file B includes file A, the compiler will loop. Use `import` when in doubt,
especially across module boundaries. Reserve `include` for flat, definition-only
files that carry no `func` or `export` declarations.

---

## Token Kinds and Enums

The calculator recognises three token kinds: a number to push, an addition
operator, and a multiplication operator. In the source, these are declared as an
enum:

```zax
enum TokenKind Number, Add, Multiply
```

An enum assigns sequential integer values starting at zero. `TokenKind.Number`
is 0, `TokenKind.Add` is 1, `TokenKind.Multiply` is 2. Enum members must be
referenced with the qualified form `EnumType.Member` — bare `Number` or `Add`
is a compile error. The compiler resolves `TokenKind.Add` to the integer `1` at
compile time; there is no runtime enum object.

The token kind array uses these names directly in its initializer:

```zax
token_kinds: byte[5] = { TokenKind.Number, TokenKind.Number, TokenKind.Add, TokenKind.Number, TokenKind.Multiply }
```

This is the same initializer position as a literal integer — `TokenKind.Add`
and `1` are identical to the compiler, but `TokenKind.Add` tells the reader
what the value means. The same names appear in the `case` labels of the dispatch
below, so the connection between the stored kind and the dispatch arm is visible
without needing to count integer values.

---

## The Evaluation Loop and Operator Dispatch

The main evaluation function is `rpn_demo`. Its shape is a `while` loop over
`token_index`, advancing with `step token_index` at the bottom of each
iteration. When `token_index` reaches `TokenCount`, the loop pops the final
result and returns it in HL.

Inside the loop, operator dispatch uses `select`:

```zax
    select A
      case TokenKind.Number
        l := token_index
        hl := token_values[L]
        word_stack.push_word value_stack, stack_depth, hl
        stack_depth := a
      case TokenKind.Add
        word_stack.pop_word value_stack, stack_depth
        stack_depth := a
        right_value := hl
        word_stack.pop_word value_stack, stack_depth
        stack_depth := a
        left_value := hl
        hl := left_value
        de := right_value
        add hl, de
        word_stack.push_word value_stack, stack_depth, hl
        stack_depth := a
      case TokenKind.Multiply
        ...
    end
```

(From `learning/part2/examples/unit7/rpn_calculator.zax`, lines 77–105.)

`select A` tests the value currently in A against each `case` constant. When
`current_kind` has been loaded into A at the top of the loop body, `select`
routes to the right arm directly. This is cleaner than a chain of `if`
comparisons for a dispatch-by-value pattern; the intent — "pick a case based on
the kind of this token" — reads directly in the code.

The operator arms follow the same structure: pop right operand, pop left operand
(order matters for non-commutative operations), apply, push result. Each pop/push
pair is bracketed by `stack_depth := a` to capture the updated depth. The typed
locals `right_value` and `left_value` hold the popped words across the two pop
calls, because HL is overwritten by the second pop before the operation can
proceed. Saving intermediate results into locals before the next call — the same
pattern seen in the recursion chapter — is the right approach here.

---

## A Note on `word_stack.zax`

`push_word` and `pop_word` are short. Here is the push:

```zax
export func push_word(stack_slots: word[], depth_count: byte, value_word: word): AF
  a := depth_count
  ld l, a
  de := value_word
  stack_slots[L] := de
  a := depth_count
  inc a
end
```

(From `learning/part2/examples/unit7/word_stack.zax`, lines 6–14.)

`word_stack.zax` loads the depth count into L with `ld l, a` — L is the index token for the `arr[L]` path expression — while DE carries the word value via `de := value_word`. `stack_slots[L] := de` then stores it cleanly. The pattern — index in L, value in DE — is how ZAX does word-array access with an 8-bit index.

The full source of `word_stack.zax` is short enough to read in one sitting — see `learning/part2/examples/unit7/word_stack.zax`.

---

## Typed Paths Through the Evaluation Loop

The evaluation loop in `rpn_demo` is built on typed locals: `token_index`,
`current_kind`, `right_value`, `left_value`. These names carry the
algorithm's intent across what would otherwise be a tangle of register
assignments. Without them, the code would require careful tracking of which
register holds which intermediate value at each point in the dispatch arms — the
same manual tracking that raw assembly requires and that ZAX structured storage
eliminates.

The typed paths do not hide anything. `right_value := hl` emits a frame store;
`de := right_value` emits a frame load. The compiler handles the IX-relative
mechanics. What you read is the algorithm: the right operand is saved, the left
operand is popped, the operation is applied.

---

## Summary

- `import "module.zax"` makes exported functions available under the module
  name. Calls are qualified: `word_stack.push_word`.
- `include "file.zax"` inserts the text of another file at the current position.
  Definitions land in the including file's namespace with no qualifier. Use for
  shared constants, types, and `op` libraries — not for modules with their own
  functions. `include` has no circular-detection; prefer `import` when in doubt.
- `enum TypeName Member, Member, ...` assigns sequential integers starting at 0.
  Members must be referenced as `TypeName.Member`; bare member names are compile
  errors. Enum members are compile-time immediates — the same as `const` values,
  but grouped under a type name that makes their relationship explicit.
- `select A` / `case TokenKind.Member` dispatches on the value in A. It is the
  natural form for token-kind dispatch, replacing a chain of `if` comparisons
  where the distinguishing value is already in a register.
- A software stack over a typed word array requires explicit depth management.
  Every push and pop returns a new depth in A, and the caller must store it.
- DE-as-value, L-as-index is the right register choice for word-array push/pop
  when HL is needed for the store address. This is visible in `word_stack.zax`
  and worth understanding.
- Store intermediate results into typed locals before the next call overwrites
  HL. This is the same pattern as the recursion chapter, applied here to a
  software-stack evaluator.
- `extern func name(params): ret at $ADDR` binds a ZAX callable name to a
  fixed ROM address. The calling convention is declared as normal; the compiler
  generates a `call` to the absolute address.
- `extern binName ... end` declares multiple entry points as offsets from a
  `bin` base, allowing a whole ROM module to be named without hard-coding
  absolute addresses.
- `bin name in code from "file.bin"` embeds a binary file into a section.
  The name is an `addr` pointing to the first byte of the blob.
- `hex name from "file.hex"` reads an Intel HEX file and places its bytes at
  the absolute addresses in the HEX records. The name binds to the lowest
  written address.

## Integrating with the outside world

`import` and `include` connect ZAX files to each other. Three more features
connect ZAX programs to the outside world: existing ROM routines, binary files,
and Intel HEX images.

### `extern func`: calling fixed-address routines

ROM monitors, BIOS tables, and legacy firmware expose callable routines at fixed
addresses in the Z80 address space. `extern func` binds a ZAX function name to
one of those fixed addresses.

```zax
extern func rst08(): void at $0008
```

After this declaration, `rst08` in any function body generates a `call $0008`.

ZAX passes arguments on the stack. Most ROM routines expect arguments in
registers instead. For those routines, declare `extern func` with no parameters
and set the registers manually before the call:

```zax
ld a, $41   ; 'A' — load the argument the ROM routine expects in A
rst08       ; generates: call $0008
```

The call site names the routine and the compiler emits the `call` — but loading
the correct registers before the call is your responsibility. If the ROM routine
clobbers something you did not account for, that is also your responsibility to
work around. ZAX does not know the ROM's register ABI; it only knows the address.

### `extern` block: relative entry points

When a binary module exposes several entry points at offsets from a common base,
an `extern` block names them all relative to that base:

```zax
bin legacy in code from "asm80/legacy.bin"
extern legacy
  func legacy_init(): void at $0000
  func legacy_putc(ch: byte): void at $0030
end
```

`legacy` is the base name of the binary blob. Every `func` in the `extern`
block is resolved as an offset from `legacy`'s base address. If the blob is
placed at `$C000`, then `legacy_putc` resolves to `$C030`. This is how you
bind a complete ROM module — with multiple callable entry points — without
hard-coding any absolute address in the ZAX source.

### `bin`: embedding binary data

`bin` reads a binary file from disk and emits its bytes into a section:

```zax
section data assets
  sprites: bin "sprites.bin"
end
```

`sprites` becomes an address-valued name pointing to the first byte of the
embedded data. The file's full content lands in the binary at that address.
Use `bin` for sprite sheets, font tables, lookup tables, and any pre-built data
blob where the bytes are already exactly what you need.

The compiler resolves the file path the same way it resolves `import` paths:
first relative to the current source file, then via the search path. A missing
file is a compile error.

### `hex`: embedding Intel HEX images

`hex` reads an Intel HEX file and places its data at the absolute addresses
specified in the HEX records:

```zax
hex firmware from "monitor.hex"
```

The name `firmware` binds to the lowest address written by the HEX file. Unlike
`bin`, which fills a section sequentially, `hex` writes to absolute addresses —
the addresses come from the HEX records themselves, not from a section
placement. Checksums are validated; an invalid record is a compile error.

Use `hex` when the data source is an Intel HEX file, as is common with Z80
development tools and EPROM programmers.

---

## What Comes Next

Chapter 08 works with pointer fields and typed reinterpretation. The linked
list and binary search tree examples require following stored addresses rather
than advancing an index — a structurally different traversal from the software
stack here, but using the same typed-path and null-sentinel approach.

---

## Exercises

1. The `TokenKind.Multiply` case calls the helper `mul_u16`. `mul_u16` uses a
   `while` loop with a `step ..., -1` on the repeat count. What is the time complexity
   of this multiplication, and what would happen for large operands? How would
   you extend `rpn_calculator.zax` to add a `TokenKind.Subtract` case?

2. `stack_depth` is a module-level variable, not a local. What would happen if
   two calls to `rpn_demo` ran in sequence? Is the initial `ld a, 0` /
   `stack_depth := a` at the top of `rpn_demo` necessary for correct behaviour
   on the first call? On subsequent calls?

3. The `select` dispatch is on `current_kind`, loaded into A before the
   `select A`. What would happen if a token kind not covered by any `case`
   appeared in the stream? What defensive measure would you add?

4. `pop_word` returns its result in HL and the new depth in A simultaneously
   (`HL, AF` return declaration). After each pop in the calculator, `stack_depth
:= a` captures the new depth. What would happen if this assignment were
   omitted for the second of the two pops in the `TokenKind.Add` arm?
