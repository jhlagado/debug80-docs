# 17. The CCP

Checked against TEC-OS 08da4d6, with the starter card's `EDIT.COM` from Edit
845d062, whose copy on the card has the SHA-256
`ed88337e6dfa2626dd37a225a0ec09332f4927a0bde62114bbf8661d2d0fdc78`.

The CCP prints the prompt, reads a command line and carries it out, as Chapter
3 describes from the keyboard's side. This chapter describes the CCP's code:
its entry from cold and warm boot, the prompt, and the parsing of the command
word and file names. It then covers the built-in commands, the loading of a
program with its page zero, and the CCP's RAM and stack.

## The CCP in the ROM

The CCP's code is `src/cpm/ccp.asm`. In the debug80 build it runs from
`CCPBAS`, `D795h`, to `E0C9h`, 2,357 bytes, followed directly by the BDOS. Its
messages and the names of its built-in commands are in the ROM's data block
(`src/data3.asm:7-71`). The exception is `TYPE`, whose name sits in front of
the `RET` at `C01Dh` (`src/data.asm:8-13`). The CCP's variables, buffers and
stack are in RAM, from `CCPRAM`, `BCEBh`, to `BE76h` (`src/ram.asm:64-128`).

The CCP is an ordinary CP/M program in most of what it does. It reads and
writes files and the console through `CALL 0005h`, as a program in the TPA
does. `DIR` lists with functions 17 and 18, `TYPE` reads with function 20 and
`ERA` erases with function 19 (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:450-452`,
`src/cpm/ccp.asm:800-803`, `src/cpm/ccp.asm:869-872`).

Outside that interface the CCP reads a few of TEC-OS's own bytes: the
console's width and height at `0048h` and `0049h`, the console mode, the
IOBYTE and the top of the TPA at `0007h`. It also reads the BDOS's flags
`HFLAG` and `WRFLAG` and the return code `PRGCODE`. It calls a few of TEC-OS's
routines directly: startup's `STBOOT` and `STLINE`, the driver loader and the
driver commands' routines `CMDDRV` and `DRVUNL`. The others are `GLCLD` for
`CON UC1`, the PRL loader and the BDOS's division, `DIV16`
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:246-249`, `src/cpm/ccp.asm:1063`, `src/cpm/ccp.asm:1100`).

## The entry from boot

Cold boot and warm boot both end with a jump to `CCPENT`, with `C` holding the
byte at `0004h`. That byte has the user number in bits 4 to 7 and the drive in
bits 0 to 3 (`src/boot.asm:80-82`, `src/cpm/ccp.asm:23-52`). Cold boot sets it
to 0, drive A and user 0, before it falls into warm boot
(`src/boot.asm:51-52`). Warm boot's `PZINIT` leaves it as the CCP last wrote
it (`src/boot.asm:215-217`), so the CCP comes back to the drive and user it
was on.

`CCPENT` sets its stack and keeps the drive in `BOOTDRV`
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:27-30`). It sets `WRFLAG` and calls function 13, the disk
reset. With that flag the reset keeps the drives whose allocation vectors are
unchanged, as Chapter 16 describes. `CCPENT` then calls function 32 with the
user number from the byte (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:31-45`). `STBOOT` reads `A:STARTUP.CMD`
the first time it is called after a cold boot and does nothing later
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:46`, `src/drv.asm:327-360`). Chapter 22 describes startup.
Last, if the drive is not A, the CCP selects it with function 14
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:47-52`). Then it prints a new line and starts its loop at
`STARTED` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:54-56`).

The selection at the end can fail. If the drive in the byte has lost its
volume, function 14 gives the `Select` error. After a key, the error's warm
boot comes back to `CCPENT` with the same byte, which selects the same drive
again. That happens when a program unmounts the current drive. Here `MOUNT`,
from drive A, takes the volume off drive B while B is the current drive. Each
of the two keys `x` and Return after it gives the error again. Only the reset
button, whose cold boot sets the byte to 0, ends it:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs B: "@start A:MOUNT B:" "@start x" "@reset" -->
```text
A>B:
B>A:MOUNT B:
Unmounted

Bdos Err On B: Select
Bdos Err On B: Select
Bdos Err On B: Select
TEC-OS 0.1 for TEC-1G
A: SYSTEM     

A>PICO.DRV
PICO.DRV?

A>GLCD.DRV
GLCD.DRV?

A>
```

The reset finds the card's volumes again, with drive B left empty. The
selection a reset keeps is the one that was in RAM, as Chapter 14 describes.
`MOUNT B:` from drive A, or `A:` before it, leaves the drive byte on A and
gives no error.

## The prompt and the line

`MAINLOOP` sets the stack again and calls `SAVEDU`. That routine reads the
user number with function 32 and the drive with function 25, and writes both
into the byte at `0004h` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:58-60`, `src/cpm/ccp.asm:192-211`).
Every prompt therefore leaves `0004h` matching the drive and user in use, so a
warm boot started by a program returns to them. The prompt is the drive's
letter and `>` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:61-65`), and the user number is not shown.

A line has three sources, in order. The first is what is left of a chained
line, the second the startup file through `STLINE`, and the last the keyboard
through BDOS function 10, with `HFLAG` set for the history
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:66-75`). For the keyboard the CCP's buffer is `CMDBUF`, with
`CMDLEN` after it for the count and `CMDTXT` for the characters
(`src/ram.asm:75-80`). Warm boot sets the buffer's maximum to 127
(`src/boot.asm:280-281`).

`MLTAKE` takes one piece of the line up to its `!`, turns its letters to
capitals and sets `PRGCODE`, the return code, to 0
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:106-149`). Chapter 25 describes the chained line, the `:`
test, the return code and the ways the rest of a line is dropped. Chapter 22
describes the startup file.

## Drive changes and the command word

With the piece ready, `MLTAKE` tests for a change of drive: a letter from `A`
to `P`, a colon and nothing after them but spaces (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:146-171`).
For a change the CCP stores the drive in `BOOTDRV`, selects it with function
14 and calls `SAVEDU`. A drive with no volume gives the `Select` error before
`SAVEDU` runs. The byte at `0004h` then keeps the old drive, and the warm boot
after the error returns to it.

Anything else is a command. `NOTDRIVE` starts a new line on the screen, passes
over spaces and parses the first word with `CMDPARSE`, as a file name, into
`CMDFCB` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:213-219`). `CMDSTRT` keeps where the word starts,
for an error message. `ARGSTRT` keeps where it ends, the start of the
arguments. A word that doesn't parse as a file name is a bad command already
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:309-314`).

The CCP then compares the word with the names of its ten built-in commands, in
the order `DIR`, `TYPE`, `ERA`, `REN`, `SAVE`, `USER`, `CON`, `COPY`, `UNLOAD`
and `DRIVERS` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:220-249`). `ISCMD` compares the text at
`CMDSTRT`, not the FCB, and requires a space or the end of the piece after the
name (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1491-1511`). So `A:DIR` and `DIR.COM` are not the
built-in. The first is the program `DIR` on drive A and the second the program
`DIR`, and both fail with no `DIR.COM` on the card.

A word that is none of the built-ins names a program, and must be a single
file name with no wildcard (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:250-252`). The type selects what
follows. A type of `DRV` installs a driver through `DRVGO`
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:253-262`, `src/glcd.asm:65-93`), which Chapter 20 describes.
Any other type, or none, is replaced by `COM` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:263-268`), so
`VOLS.TXT` runs `VOLS.COM`.

A command that fails ends at `BADCMD`. It prints the word from `CMDSTRT` up to
its first space with a question mark after it, then a new line
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:315-334`). `BADCMD` and the built-ins' messages of failure
go through `ERRGO`, which sets the return code to `FF00h` first
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:335-341`). Chapter 25 lists them. `ERRGO` and the built-ins
end at one of two labels. `STARTED` starts a new line and prints the prompt.
`MAINLOOP` prints the prompt on the line the command left.

## File names

`PARSEFCB` reads one file reference into the first 16 bytes of an FCB and
leaves `HL` at the character after it (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1296-1401`). It first
clears all 36 bytes of the FCB: 0 for the drive, spaces for the name and type,
zeros for the rest. A command after `TYPE` then loads from the start of its
file and not from where `TYPE` stopped (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1300-1325`). A letter
and a colon at the start set the drive byte, 1 to 16 for `A` to `P`. Any other
character before the colon is an error (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1327-1343`). Up to
eight characters go into the name and, after a full stop, up to three into the
type (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1345-1365`).

A name ends at a 0, a space, `=` or `.` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1473-1482`). Inside
it, `*` fills the rest of its field with `?` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1458-1471`).
`VALIDCHR` rejects the thirteen characters in `BADCHARS`, the ones CP/M 2.2
reserves: `<`, `>`, `,`, `;`, `:`, `[`, `]`, `%`, `|`, `(`, `)`, `/` and `\`
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1433-1456`, `src/data3.asm:70-71`). A field with more
characters than it holds is an error too. `PARLONG` moves past the rest of the
word and returns the error flag (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1383-1401`).

Commands that take exactly one file are `TYPE`, `REN`, `SAVE`, `COPY` and a
program's name. They test the parsed FCB with `UNAMBIG`, which rejects an
empty name and any `?` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1403-1431`).

## The built-in commands

Each built-in is a routine in `ccp.asm` or, for the driver commands, in
`drv.asm`:

| Command | Routine | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIR` | `CMDDIR` | `src/cpm/ccp.asm:404-617` |
| `TYPE` | `CMDTYPE` | `src/cpm/ccp.asm:785-828` |
| `ERA` | `CMDERA` | `src/cpm/ccp.asm:834-878` |
| `REN` | `CMDREN` | `src/cpm/ccp.asm:880-925` |
| `SAVE` | `CMDSAVE` | `src/cpm/ccp.asm:1161-1259` |
| `USER` | `CMDUSER` | `src/cpm/ccp.asm:1129-1159` |
| `CON` | `CMDCON` | `src/cpm/ccp.asm:1067-1127` |
| `COPY` | `CMDCOPY` | `src/cpm/ccp.asm:927-1059` |
| `UNLOAD` | `CMDUNL` | `src/cpm/ccp.asm:1061-1065`, `src/drv.asm:26-52` |
| `DRIVERS` | `CMDDRV` | `src/drv.asm:301-325` |

`DIR` turns a missing name into eleven `?` and sets the DMA address to
`LOADBUF`. It lists the entries that function 17 and then function 18 return
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:404-452`). An entry whose system attribute, bit 7 of its
second type byte, is set is passed over (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:467-472`). The CCP's
FCB has extent 0, so only the entry that holds a file's first extent matches,
and each file is listed once. The number of columns is the console's width at
`0048h` divided by 13, at least one. A width of 0, on the serial terminal, is
taken as 80 (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:431-448`). Each name is printed as `NAME.EXT`,
padded to 12 characters unless it ends the row (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:488-533`).

`DIR`'s last line gives the number of files and the free space on the drive it
listed (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:546-617`). For the free space it selects that drive
with function 14, if the listing named one. It takes the DPB's address from
function 31 and the allocation vector's from function 27. It then counts the
clear bits for the `DSM` + 1 blocks of the volume. The count of blocks is
shifted left by `BSH` less 3 to give KiB: 2 KiB a block on G1M, 4 on G8M. Then
it selects the drive from `0004h` again. A listing with no file gives
`NO FILE`.

`DIR` and `TYPE` print through the pager (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:619-732`). `PGINIT`
takes the console's height and width from `0049h` and `0048h`, or 24 and 80 on
the serial terminal. It keeps one row for the pause. `PGPUT` counts each
character's column: back to 0 at CR, back one at backspace and on to the next
multiple of 8 at a tab. It counts a new line at LF and at a character that
would pass the last column, as the screen wraps it. When the rows are full it
prints `[more]` and waits with function 6, so that the key is not echoed.
`UNMORE` then writes a CR, six spaces and a CR over `[more]`. `^C`, Esc and
`Q` or `q` stop the listing, and any other key shows the next screen.

`TYPE` opens its one file and reads it a record at a time into `LOADBUF`. It
prints each byte through the pager up to the first `^Z`, `1Ah`, or the end of
the file (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:785-828`). A file that is not there gives
`NO FILE`.

`ERA` with a name that is all `?`, as `*.*` gives, prints `ALL (Y/N)?`, reads
the answer with function 1 and reads on to a CR. Any answer but `Y` or `y`
erases nothing (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:845-867`). The erase itself is function 19,
and `NO FILE` when nothing matched (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:869-878`).

`REN NEW=OLD` parses the new name into `RENFCB` and the old one into `CMDFCB`,
and searches for the new name first. If it is there the command gives
`FILE EXISTS` with nothing changed (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:880-910`). Otherwise the
first 12 bytes of `RENFCB` are copied to offset 16 of `CMDFCB`. Offset 16 is
the second drive byte, and the new name follows it at offset 17, the place
function 23 reads it. The rename gives `NO FILE` if the old name is not there
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:912-925`).

`SAVE N NAME` reads a decimal count of 256-byte pages and rejects any count
that reaches the page of the word at `0006h`. It erases the file, makes it
again and writes the pages from `0100h` on, two records each
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1161-1259`). On the starter card that page is `B8h`, so the
largest `SAVE` is 183 pages, `0100h` to `B7FFh`. A failed make, write or close
gives `NO SPACE`.

`USER N` takes 0 to 15 and calls function 32 (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1129-1159`).
`CON` with no argument names the console in use. With `TTY`, `CRT`, `BAT` or
`UC1`, a colon after it allowed, it sets the IOBYTE's console field. For `UC1`
it also loads `GLCD.DRV` if it is not in (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1067-1127`).
Chapter 15 describes the BIOS's side.

`COPY SOURCE DEST` copies a file within the user area
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:927-1059`). Both names are parsed with the current drive put
in a 0 drive byte, so that they can be compared. A destination with no name
takes the source's whole name. A destination equal to the source, all 12
bytes, is a bad command, with nothing opened (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:960-986`). The
copy goes a record at a time through the default DMA record at `0080h`, so it
uses none of the TPA. The count of records is kept in `DIRNUM` and printed in
hex after `COPIED` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:987-1032`).

`DRIVERS` prints each driver's name and its pages from the list of drivers,
and `UNLOAD` removes the lowest. `NAME.DRV` as a command installs one. Chapter
20 describes the three.

## Loading a program

`LOADCOM` loads a `.COM` file at `0100h` through the BDOS
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:343-402`). It opens `CMDFCB`, and if there is no such file
it returns with the carry flag and the zero flag set. Otherwise it reads the
file a record at a time, with function 26 setting the DMA address to each
record's place from `0100h` up. The reading stops at the end of the file or
when the address reaches the page of the word at `0006h`, the byte at `0007h`
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:352-370`).

At that page the file still has to end. `LOADLIM` reads one more record into
`LOADBUF` to find out. If that read is the end of the file the load is
complete. Otherwise the file is too large, and the carry flag is set with the
zero flag clear (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:372-386`). A file that fits leaves in
`LOADTOP` the address after its last record, which the PRL loader uses, and is
closed (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:388-398`).

The largest program is therefore the 256-byte pages from `0100h` up to the
page that holds the BDOS entry. On the starter card, whose entry is at
`B806h`, that is 46,848 bytes, six fewer than the TPA. With a driver loaded
the word at `0006h` is the driver's jump, at offset 6 of the driver's first
page. The limit is then that page.

The examples from here on use a copy of the starter card with three files on
drive B. Two are programs that are a `RET` and zeros, of 46,848 and 46,849
bytes. The third is `ARGS`, whose source, saved as `build/args.asm`, is in the
section on page zero below:

```sh
node -e 'const b = n => { const x = Buffer.alloc(n); x[0] = 0xC9; return x; };
require("fs").writeFileSync("build/fits.com", b(46848));
require("fs").writeFileSync("build/big.com", b(46849));'
npx atom build/args.asm build/args.com
cp dist/starter.img build/ccp.img
node tools/tecvol.mjs put build/ccp.img B build/args.com
node tools/tecvol.mjs put build/ccp.img B build/fits.com
node tools/tecvol.mjs put build/ccp.img B build/big.com
```

`FITS.COM`, 46,848 bytes, loads and runs, and `BIG.COM`, one byte more,
doesn't:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs --card build/ccp.img B: FITS BIG -->
```text
A>B:
B>FITS

B>BIG
BIG?

B>
```

`NOTDRIVE` calls `LOADCOM` for `NAME.COM` first (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:263-271`). A
file that is there but too large is a bad command at once. Only when there is
no `NAME.COM` does the CCP change the type to `PRL` and call `LOADCOM` again.
It then calls `PRLGO`, which checks the PRL's header against what was loaded
and moves the code down from `0200h` to `0100h` (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:272-279`,
`src/prl.asm:12-58`). Chapter 21 describes the PRL loader. A read error during
a load is a `Bad Sector` from the BDOS, which ends the command by warm boot
before `LOADCOM` returns.

## Page zero and the jump

A loaded program gets the page zero that CP/M 2.2 defines. `PREPPAGE` parses
the first two words of the arguments into the FCBs at `005Ch` and `006Ch`. It
copies the arguments to `0080h`, the command tail, with their length in front
and a 0 after them. It sets the DMA address to `0080h` with function 26
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:1261-1294`). The tail starts with the space after the
command's name and ends at the end of the piece. Its letters are the capitals
`MLTAKE` made.

The second FCB starts 16 bytes after the first. `PREPPAGE` parses it second,
so its drive and name are complete and the first FCB's last 20 bytes are not.
The tail, written last, takes the second FCB's last 16 bytes in turn.

`ARGS` prints what the CCP left there: each FCB's drive byte as a digit and
its eleven name bytes, then the tail between brackets.

```asm
; ARGS: prints the two FCBs and the command tail that the CCP leaves in
; page zero: each FCB's drive byte as a digit and its eleven name bytes,

```

The first FCB names the current drive with 0 and the second drive A with 1.
The `*` of `*.C` is eight `?`. The tail of `ARGS X Y` keeps the space before
the `!`, and a command with no arguments gets blank FCBs and a tail of
length 0.

Then the CCP starts the program (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:280-286`). It sets the stack
pointer to `CSTKTOP`, the top of its own stack, pushes `0000h` and jumps to
`0100h`. A program that ends with `RET` returns to `0000h`, the jump to warm
boot. So does one that jumps to `0000h` or calls function 0. The CCP prints a
new line at `STARTED` after the warm boot. A program that ends its output with
a new line is therefore followed by a blank line before the prompt.

## The CCP's RAM and stack

The CCP's block of RAM has two parts, divided at `CCPCLR`
(`src/ram.asm:67-128`). Below it are the parts that warm boot keeps: the two
FCBs and the command line. The next piece of a chained line therefore survives
the program before it. From `CCPCLR` on, warm boot clears the CCP's bytes
along with the BDOS's (`src/boot.asm:270-277`).

| `BDB5h` | 1 | `BOOTDRV` | the drive from `0004h` at entry, or of a drive change |
| `BDB6h–BDCBh` | 22 | | the parser's pointers and the state of `DIR`, the pager, `SAVE` and `ERA` |
| `BDCCh–BE4Bh` | 128 | `LOADBUF` | scratch: `DIR`'s and `REN`'s directory records, `TYPE`'s records, the load's extra record |
| `BE4Ch–BE58h` | 13 | `STKGUARD` | the stack guard, `A5h` in each byte |
| `BE59h–BE76h` | 30 | `CSTKBAS` | the CCP's stack, up to `CSTKTOP` at `BE77h` |

The addresses are those of the debug80 build. The guard is 43 bytes less the
stack's 30 (`src/ram.asm:119-124`), and warm boot fills it with `A5h`
(`src/boot.asm:282-286`). A guard byte that is no longer `A5h` shows that the
stack has run past its bottom. `test/stacks.test.mjs` checks the guard after
the CCP's deepest paths, and Chapter 13 describes the measurement behind the
stack's size.

The stack is the CCP's and, from the jump to `0100h`, the program's. With
`0000h` pushed, the program starts with 28 bytes below its return word, more
than the 16 of CP/M 2.2's eight levels. Its stack pointer is in the workspace
above the TPA (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:281-283`, `src/layout.asm:76-81`). A program
that needs more sets its own stack, as many CP/M programs do. Every BDOS call
moves to the BDOS's stack, so a program's calls of `0005h` use only two bytes
of the program's stack.

The CCP keeps nothing in the TPA. It leaves the program area from `0100h`
untouched until it loads a program or a driver there, a driver for `NAME.DRV`
or `CON UC1` (`src/glcd.asm:68`, `src/drv.asm:54`). Only `SAVE` reads that
area, which is how `SAVE` writes what a program or a loaded driver file left
in memory.
