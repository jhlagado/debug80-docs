# Appendix G. The TEC-1G as TEC-OS uses it

Checked against TEC-OS 98c6416.

This appendix lists the parts of the TEC-1G that TEC-OS reads and writes: its
ports, the bits of the system latch, the configuration switches, the RAM in
socket U9, the hex keypad, the 8 × 8 LEDs, the DS1302 clock and the SD card
adaptor. It describes the board as the code uses it. TEC-OS has run only on
the host model, and where the model and the TEC-1G's own
documents differ, the difference is noted with the test of the diagnostics ROM
that settles it (Chapter 24).

## The ports

The port numbers are defined in `src/layout.asm:8-13`, with the devices' own
in the files that drive them.

| Port | Direction | Device | TEC-OS's use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `00h` | in | Hex keypad encoder | Read and discarded in each serial wait loop |
| `01h` | out | Digit select and serial | Bits 0 to 5 select the 7-segment digits, bit 6 is the serial line's output, bit 7 the speaker |
| `02h` | out | 7-segment segments | Service `DIGIT` |
| `03h` | in | System input | Bit 0 the Matrix switch, bit 6 a keypad key down, bit 7 the serial line's input |
| `04h` | in, out | 20 × 4 LCD, instructions and status | The busy flag, the LCD's setup and its rows |
| `84h` | out | 20 × 4 LCD, data | The same |
| `05h`, `06h`, `F8h`, `F9h` | out | 8 × 8 LEDs | No service; `DEMO` writes them |
| `07h`, `87h` | in, out | Graphics LCD, ST7920 | `GLCD.DRV` only |
| `BEh`, `BFh` | in, out | PICO9918, data and control | The probe at cold boot; the console and service `VIDEO`'s restore, both in `PICO.DRV` |
| `FCh` | in, out | DS1302 clock | Services `INFO` and `RTC` |
| `FDh` | in, out | SD card adaptor | The SD card driver |
| `FEh` | in | Matrix keyboard and joystick | The keyboard scan, services `KEYS` and `JOY` |
| `FFh` | out | System latch | Overlay, banks and the Caps lamp |

The read of port `00h` takes nothing from the keypad. It is there for the
Debug80 runtime, whose serial input starts a queued byte at a read of that port
(`src/layout.asm:9`, `src/console.asm:129`, `src/console.asm:183`,
`src/console.asm:283`).

## Port 01h and the serial line

Port `01h` carries three things at once: the digit select in bits 0 to 5, the
serial line's output in bit 6 and the speaker in bit 7 (`src/layout.asm:10`).
Every write to it has to keep bit 6 high when the serial line is idle, or the
terminal receives a start bit. The ROM's own writes do: the `DIGIT` service
lights each digit with bit 6 set, and the `TONE` service toggles bit 7 with
bit 6 set (`src/hwsvc.asm:45`, `src/hwsvc.asm:91-104`,
`src/hwsvc.asm:180-197`). That shared port is why programs reach the digits
and the speaker through the services of Chapter 9 and not by writing the port.

The serial line is bit-banged: TEC-OS sends each bit by writing bit 6 of port
`01h` and receives by sampling bit 7 of port `03h`, at 4800 baud, 8 data bits,
no parity and 2 stop bits. The bit times are counted in T-states for a 4 MHz
clock (`tools/build.mjs:25`, `tools/build.mjs:40-57`,
`src/console.asm:193-200`), so the board's CPU clock switch has to be on FAST
with the 4 MHz oscillator. There is no receive buffer in hardware: a byte
reaches TEC-OS only while it is polling bit 7 for a start bit.

## Port 03h and the switches

TEC-OS reads three bits of port `03h` (`src/layout.asm:11`):

- **Bit 0, the Matrix switch.** Read once, at cold boot, into `CONDEV`
  (`src/console.asm:41-43`). With the switch off the console never scans the
  matrix keyboard, and both display drivers fail to install, since each needs
  the keyboard.
- **Bit 6, a keypad key down.** Read once, at cold boot, just before the
  startup file is opened. A low bit skips the file (`src/svc.asm:336-338`).
- **Bit 7, the serial line's input.** Read by the serial routines
  (`src/console.asm:131`, `src/console.asm:184`, `src/console.asm:198`).

The TEC-1G's documents and the Debug80 runtime describe the other bits of port
`03h` differently. On bit 6 the two agree: it is low while a keypad key is
down, which is how TEC-OS reads it (`src/svc.asm:336-338`).
`docs/diagnostics.md` records the comparison, and test T11 reads the port on a
board. The Protect and Expand switches are not read.

## The system latch

The system latch at port `FFh` can be written but, on the board's documents,
not read, so TEC-OS keeps a copy of the last value written at `0040h`,
`LATCHV`, and builds each new value from the copy (`src/layout.asm:13`,
`src/layout.asm:37`). Its bits:

| Bit | Value | Name | TEC-OS's use |
| ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `01h` | SHADOW | Set at cold boot to turn the boot overlay off, and never cleared (`src/boot.asm:11-12`) |
| 1 | `02h` | PROTECT | Not set; a program that sets it makes `4000h–7FFFh` read-only |
| 2 | `04h` | EXPAND | EXPAND 1 at `8000h–BFFFh` in place of EXPAND 0, for the block cache and the history (`src/layout.asm:18`) |
| 3 | `08h` | MAIN | Tested at cold boot for a second 32 KiB at `0000h–7FFFh` (`src/layout.asm:20`, `src/boot.asm:166-183`) |
| 7 | `80h` | CAPS | The Caps lamp, toggled with Caps Lock on the matrix keyboard (`src/console.asm:392-395`) |

At reset the latch is `00h`, and with bit 0 low the first 2 KiB of the ROM
also appear at `0000h–07FFh`. That is how the Z80, which starts at `0000h`,
reaches the ROM: the jump there leads to `COLD` at its `C000h` address, which
writes `01h` to the latch (`src/reset.asm:1-6`, `src/boot.asm:9-12`). A
program that writes the latch itself has to write `0040h` to match, since
TEC-OS's next write to the latch is made from the copy.

EXPAND is set only while no stack is in use, since the stacks TEC-OS uses once
cold boot has set them up are in `8000h–BFFFh`, in EXPAND 0
(`src/history.asm:16-42`, `src/cache.asm:11-14`). Bits 3 to 6 are a bank field
for the window in the Debug80 runtime, and unconnected to U9 in the board's
documents. TEC-OS uses bit 2 for EXPAND 1 and bit 3 only for the test above.
Test T12 of the diagnostics ROM reports what a board does with them.

## U9 and the RAM

TEC-OS needs 64 KiB of RAM: the board's fixed 32 KiB at `0000h–7FFFh` and a 32
KiB RAM in socket U9 for `8000h–BFFFh`, whose two 16 KiB halves are EXPAND 0
and EXPAND 1. The board's recommended build leaves U9 empty, and
`docs/board-run.md` gives the chip as a 62256 or similar, with the board's
EXPAND jumpers set for a 32 KiB chip. Cold boot tests `8000h–BFFFh` before it
prints anything, and EXPAND 1 later, and stops with `TEC-OS needs 64K RAM` on
the serial terminal if either is missing (`src/boot.asm:22`,
`src/boot.asm:143-148`, `src/boot.asm:291-303`). Chapter 1 describes the two
checks, and Chapter 13 what TEC-OS keeps in each half.

## The hex keypad and its NMI

TEC-OS takes no keys from the hex keypad. Its one use of the keypad is the
key-down bit of port `03h`, read once at cold boot for the startup file's
skip.

With the board's keypad NMI jumper fitted, a key press makes a non-maskable
interrupt, and the Z80 pushes its return address and jumps to `0066h`. TEC-OS
puts no handler there. `0066h` is inside CP/M's default file control block,
`005Ch–007Fh`, which programs and the CCP write, so an NMI runs whatever bytes
the FCB holds. `docs/board-run.md` lists TEC-OS as running with the jumper
off. A press with the jumper fitted is a crash.

## The 8 × 8 LEDs

No TEC-OS service drives the 8 × 8 LEDs, and the ROM never writes their ports.
`DEMO` on the starter card writes them itself, as the Debug80 runtime decodes
them: port `05h` selects a row, and `06h`, `F8h` and `F9h` light its red,
green and blue columns (`test/programs/demo.asm:14-17`,
`test/programs/demo.asm:273-286`). The TEC-1G port list makes `05h` and `06h`
the X and Y axes of a single-colour matrix, so `DEMO`'s pattern may look
different on a board. Test T24 of the diagnostics ROM records what a board
shows.

## The DS1302 clock

The DS1302 is an add-on on port `FCh`, with bit 4 the chip's enable, bit 6 its
clock, bit 7 the data sent to it, bit 5 set to read and the data read on bit 0
(`src/hwsvc.asm:41-42`). Each register is reached by a command byte sent least
significant bit first (`src/hwsvc.asm:311-317`). TEC-OS counts the clock as
present when a read of the seconds register gives a value below `60h`, which a
clock that answers gives and an empty port's `FFh` doesn't
(`src/hwsvc.asm:292-303`). The `INFO` service reports it in bit 3 of `B`, and
the `RTC` service reads and sets its seven BCD registers (Chapter 9).

## The SD card adaptor

The SD card adaptor is on port `FDh`, driven in SPI mode by bit-banging: bit 0
is the data to the card, bit 1 the clock and bit 2 the card's select, low to
select it, and the card's data comes back on bit 7 (`src/layout.asm:12`,
`src/sd.asm:1-8`). The data changes while the clock is low, and the card
samples it on the rising edge. With nothing selected the port is written
`05h`: select high, data high, clock low.

Every wait for the card has a limit, and a card that doesn't answer gives one
of the error codes of Chapter 24 and Appendix D (`src/sd.asm:4-17`). When a
block goes to or from the block cache, the transfer loop runs with EXPAND 1 in
view, writing the latch before the loop and its copy back after
(`src/sd.asm:259-263`, `src/sd.asm:357-358`, `src/sd.asm:365-368`,
`src/sd.asm:427-428`). `docs/diagnostics.md` gives the cost of a block read
with the same driver in the diagnostics ROM as 354,216 T-states and 678 for
each wait for the card, about 89 ms at 4 MHz, and test T20 measures it on a
board.
