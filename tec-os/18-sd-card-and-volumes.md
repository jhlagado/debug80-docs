# 18. The SD card and the volumes

Checked against TEC-OS 98c6416.

The BDOS reads and writes tracks and sectors of 128 bytes, and the SD card
stores numbered blocks of 512. TEC-OS joins the two in three layers. At the
bottom is a driver that exchanges data with the card over SPI, bit by bit
through one port. Above it, cold boot reads the container in the card's first
blocks and checks it. It then builds a drive table and a disk parameter header
for each drive. At the top, the BIOS's disk entries turn a track and sector
into a block of the card and a quarter of that block.

This chapter takes the layers from the bottom up, and ends with the mount
service, through which `MOUNT` and `VOLS` change and list the drives. Chapter
19 describes the block cache, which every read passes through.

## The SPI driver

The card is on the TEC-1G's SD adaptor at port `FDh` (`src/layout.asm:12`).
Three output bits drive the card's lines: bit 0 its data in (MOSI), bit 1 its
clock and bit 2 its chip select, active low. Bit 7 of the input is the card's
data out, MISO (`src/sd.asm:1-6`). Data changes while the clock is low and the
card samples it on the rising edge. Every routine returns Z on success, and on
failure NZ with an error code in `A` and in `SDERR`.

Sending a byte is eight passes of a loop. Each pass shifts the top bit of `C`
into the carry, puts it on bit 0 with the clock low, then writes the same bit
with the clock high (`src/sd.asm:19-28`). Receiving is the same loop with MOSI
held high: clock low, clock high, read the port and shift bit 7 into the
result (`src/sd.asm:30-43`). `SPIEND` raises chip select and gives the card
eight more clocks (`src/sd.asm:45-56`).

A command is six bytes after an idle `FFh`. They are the command number with
bit 6 set, four argument bytes from `SDARG`, most significant first, and a CRC
byte (`src/sd.asm:58-94`). In SPI mode the card checks the CRC only of `CMD0`
and `CMD8`. `SDCMD` sends `95h` and `87h`, the correct bytes for those two
with the arguments TEC-OS uses, and `01h`, the end bit alone, for the rest. It
then reads up to 16 bytes, waiting for the response byte R1, whose bit 7 is 0.

`SDINIT` starts the card at cold boot, and each step has its own error code
(`src/sd.asm:114-204`):

1. Chip select high and 80 clocks, more than the 74 the card needs after
   power-up, then `CMD0`, which puts the card in SPI mode and its idle state.
   The card must answer R1 = `01h`. After ten tries with no such answer the
   error is 1, `SDENOCD`, which is what an empty socket gives.
2. `CMD8` with the argument `1AAh`, the voltage range and a check pattern. A
   card of version 2 answers `01h` and four more bytes, which are read and
   ignored. An older card rejects the command, and initialisation goes on.
3. `CMD55` and `ACMD41` with the high-capacity bit set, repeated up to 256
   times with a short pause between, until R1 is 0, the card ready. Error 2,
   `SDEINIT`, if it never is.
4. `CMD58`, which returns the operating conditions register. Bit 6 of its
   first byte, CCS, is set on a high-capacity card, which takes block numbers
   as addresses. Error 3, `SDEOCR`, if the command fails.
5. On a standard-capacity card, which takes byte addresses, `SDBYTE` is set to
   1 and `CMD16` sets the block length to 512. Error 4, `SDEBLEN`, if it
   fails.

Every later access gives the driver a block number in `SDLBA`, four bytes,
least significant first. `LBAARG` turns it into the command's argument. A
high-capacity card gets the number as it is, and a standard one gets it
shifted left by 9, the block times 512 (`src/sd.asm:206-221`).

`SDREAD` reads a block with `CMD17` (`src/sd.asm:223-252`). A nonzero R1 is
error 5, `SDECMD`. The card then sends `FFh` until the data is ready and `FEh`
before it. The driver polls for that token up to 65,536 times before it gives
error 6, `SDETOK`. The 512 bytes follow, then a two-byte CRC that the driver
reads and doesn't check.

`SDWRITE` writes a block with `CMD24` (`src/sd.asm:431-477`). R1 must be 0, or
the error is 5. The driver then sends `FFh`, the token `FEh`, the 512 bytes
and two CRC bytes. The card's data response must come within 16 bytes and have
`05h` in its low five bits, data accepted, or the error is 7, `SDEWRSP`. The
card then holds its data line at 0 while it programs the block. The driver
waits up to 65,536 reads for the line to rise before it gives error 8,
`SDEBUSY`. A write therefore returns success only after the card has stopped
reporting busy.

The two block loops, `SDRBLK` and `SDWBLK`, are unrolled, with eight bits
written out in full for each byte. `SDRBLK` keeps its count of 256 two-byte
passes in the Z80's `I` register, which is free in interrupt mode 1
(`src/sd.asm:254-429`). On the model `SDREAD` takes 219,137 T-states for one
block, about 55 milliseconds, and `SDWRITE` 216,154. Nearly all of that is the
4,096 bits of the block moved one at a time.

When `SDXB` holds `LATEXP` the buffer is a line of the block cache in
EXPAND 1. Each loop then puts EXPAND 1 in view around itself and uses no stack
while it is (`src/sd.asm:258-262`, `src/sd.asm:356-359`, `src/sd.asm:364-368`,
`src/sd.asm:427-428`).

## The container's checks

The card holds one container, and its block 0 is the header. The header has
the name `TECOSVOL`, the format's version and the sizes of the header and of a
volume descriptor. It also has the number of volumes, the container's length
in blocks and a checksum. In format 1.1 it adds a drive count and a sum over
the rest of the table. The volume descriptors follow, 32 bytes each, fifteen
in block 0 and sixteen in each of blocks 1 to 7. Chapter 4 describes the
container from the user's side and Appendix E lists its fields. The offsets
the ROM uses come from `format/format.json` through the generated
`gen/format.asm`, as Chapter 12 describes.

`MOUNT` reads block 0 into `BLKBUF` and checks it in a fixed order, stopping
at the first failure with that check's code (`src/vol.asm:8-18`,
`src/vol.asm:20-135`):

| Code | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `20h` | block 0, or a block of the table, reads |
| `21h` | the first eight bytes are `TECOSVOL` |
| `22h` | the major version is 1 |
| `23h` | the header is 512 bytes and a descriptor 32; in 1.1, the drive count is at most 4 |
| `24h` | the volume count is from 1 to 127 |
| `25h` | the header's checksum, the 16-bit sum of its other 510 bytes; in 1.1, the table's sum |

Any minor version other than 0 is read as 1.1 (`src/vol.asm:83-85`). For a 1.1
card with more than fifteen volumes, `MOUNT` reads each further block of the
table and adds up its 512 bytes. The total must be the header's table sum
(`src/vol.asm:93-134`).

Then it walks the descriptors in table order, checking each one and mounting
it as it goes (`src/vol.asm:136-243`):

| Code | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `26h` | the volume id is not 0; no flag but read-only is set; the geometry is known; the length is that geometry's payload exactly; the start block is not 0 and a multiple of 8 |
| `28h` | the start is at or after the previous volume's end |
| `27h` | start plus length has no carry out of 32 bits, and ends within the container |
| `29h` | the drive byte is `FFh` or 0 to 3, below a 1.1 header's drive count when that count is not 0, and not a drive already taken |
| `2Ah` | after the last descriptor, drive A has a volume |

The order check makes overlapping volumes impossible, since each must start
where the one before it ended or later. The descriptors therefore have to be
in ascending order of their start block. The ROM uses only bit 0 of a
descriptor's cache byte, the written-behind flag, and doesn't check the others
(`src/vol.asm:346-350`). Any failure unmounts every drive that the walk had
mounted, so a card is mounted whole or not at all (`src/vol.asm:251-255`). The
ROM can't find the card's capacity, so a volume that runs past the end of the
card fails only when a read reaches it.

Cold boot sends any failure, of the card or of the container, to the
diagnostic prompt (`src/boot.asm:37-40`). For the run below, the starter
card's first byte was changed from `T` to `X` with
`printf X | dd of=/tmp/bad.img bs=1 seek=0 conv=notrunc` on a copy of
`dist/starter.img`. `H` was then typed at the prompt:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs --card /tmp/bad.img H -->
```text
TEC-OS 0.1 for TEC-1G
No volume mounted, error 21
R retry, H header> H
58 45 43 4F 53 56 4F 4C 01 00 00 02 20 00 02 00

53 59 53 54 45 4D 20 20 20 20 20 00 00 00 00 00 
R retry, H header> 
```

`H` prints the first 64 bytes of `BLKBUF` (`src/diag.asm:26-45`), which here
hold block 0 as read. The first row is the name, with `58h` for the `X`. Then
come the version 1.0, the header size `0200h`, the descriptor size `0020h` and
the count, 2. The second row starts with the container's length, `00005000h`
blocks, and the checksum, `07F4h`. The drives field and the table sum are 0,
as on any 1.0 card. The third and fourth rows are the first descriptor: id 1,
start block `0800h`, length `0800h`, geometry 2, flags 0, drive 0, cache byte
0 and the label `SYSTEM`.

## The drive table and the DPHs

Each descriptor that names a drive is mounted by `MNONE`
(`src/vol.asm:308-320`). `MNFILL` writes the drive's eight-byte entry in
`DRVTAB`. It holds the start block in four bytes, the length in blocks in two,
the geometry and a flags byte with read-only in bit 0 and written-behind in
bit 1 (`src/vol.asm:322-351`, `src/ram.asm:22`). `DRVIDX` records which volume
each drive holds, as its index in the container plus 1, 0 for none
(`src/ram.asm:28`). The geometry byte is 0 for a drive with no volume, and for
such a drive the BIOS's `SELDSK` returns 0, no such drive
(`src/bios.asm:23-43`).

`MNDPH` builds the drive's disk parameter header, the 16-byte block through
which the BDOS reaches a drive's parameters and buffers
(`src/vol.asm:353-389`):

| Offset | Contents |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | the sector translation table: 0, no skew |
| 2–7 | three words for the BDOS's own use, zeroed |
| 8 | `DIRBUF`, the 128-byte directory buffer every drive shares |
| 10 | the disk parameter block of the volume's geometry |
| 12 | `CSVDUM`, a check vector that is never used, since `CKS` is 0 |
| 14 | the allocation vector, set by `ALVINIT` |

The disk parameter blocks are `DPB1` and `DPB2` in `gen/geom.asm`. Both
geometries have 64 records a track, no reserved tracks and four directory
allocation blocks. G8M has 2,048 blocks of 4 KiB and 512 directory entries.
G1M has 512 blocks of 2 KiB and 256 entries. `CKS` is 0 in both: CP/M 2.2 uses
the check vector to detect a changed floppy, and the card is treated as fixed
media.

TEC-OS's BDOS uses the three scratch words for each drive. They hold a sum of
its allocation vector, a flag set when it has changed and a mark, the number
of directory entries to read when the vector is rebuilt. Together these let a
warm boot keep the drive logged in (`src/cpm/bdos.asm:468-507`). Chapter 16
describes that, and Chapter 13 how `ALVINIT` places the vectors at cold boot.

## Deblocking

The BDOS reads and writes 128-byte records through the BIOS, by track and
sector. Every geometry has 64 records a track and no reserved tracks, so the
BIOS numbers the volume's records straight through, record = track × 64 +
sector. Four records share one 512-byte block of the card
(`src/bios.asm:5-10`). `SETTRK`, `SETSEC` and `SETDMA` store their values,
`HOME` sets track 0, and `SECTRAN` returns the sector unchanged
(`src/bios.asm:12-21`).

`MAPREC` does the arithmetic (`src/bios.asm:57-125`). It rejects a sector of
64 or more and a track of 1,024 or more, whose record number would not fit in
16 bits. It keeps the record's low two bits as `BLKSLOT`, the quarter of the
block. The record divided by 4 becomes `BLKOFF`, the block within the volume.
`BLKOFF` must be less than the volume's length from the drive table. The
volume's start block is then added to it, in 32 bits, to give `SDLBA`, the
block of the card. A G8M volume's 16,384 blocks are 65,536 records, 1,024
tracks, and a G1M volume has 128 tracks.

`READ` maps the record and copies it to the DMA address through the block
cache, as Chapter 19 describes. `WRITE` has more to do
(`src/bios.asm:188-300`). After mapping it rejects a write to a read-only
volume before anything changes, with error 1. The BDOS reports that error, for
a file's data, as `Bad Sector` (`src/cpm/bdos.asm:850-864`). `WRITE` then
tests for one of the directory's blocks, the first 32 blocks of a G8M volume
or 16 of a G1M. For such a block it sets the drive's changed flag in the DPH
and raises its mark to cover the 16 entries of this block. The next warm boot
then rebuilds the drive's vector from the entries up to there
(`src/bios.asm:210-248`).

A record is a quarter of a block. Deblocking a write on a volume written
through therefore takes three steps: read the block into `BLKBUF`, copy the
record into its quarter and write the whole block back. `GETBLKW` reads the
block unless `BLKBUF` already holds it, which its key, `BUFDRV` and `BUFBLK`,
records (`src/bios.asm:127-164`).

The read is skipped when the card's copy of the block holds nothing that has
to be kept. CP/M's write type 2 marks the first write to an allocation block
the BDOS has just given the file. For it `GETBLKW` clears `BLKBUF` to zeros
instead and sets `BUFOK` to 2. The next write may go to the next block of the
same allocation block, with `BLKBUF` holding the one before it, cleared. That
block is then cleared too and not read (`src/bios.asm:249-276`).

The record goes into its quarter, found by `SLOTADR` (`src/bios.asm:166-177`),
and `SDWRITE` writes `BLKBUF` to the card. If the write fails, `BUFOK` is
cleared, since the buffer no longer matches the card, and the cache's copy of
the block is dropped. If it succeeds, the cache's copy, if it has one, is
refreshed from `BLKBUF` (`src/bios.asm:289-300`). On the volume written
behind, `WRITE` goes to the cache instead, at `CWRBH`
(`src/bios.asm:277-281`).

A program that writes a new file sequentially on a volume written through
therefore causes no card reads for its data. It causes four card writes for
each block, since the block goes to the card after each of its records.
`SAVE 8 X.COM` on drive A, 16 records in four blocks, writes 18 blocks, the 16
and two of the directory. It reads the directory's block from the card before
each of those two writes, since the data has replaced it in `BLKBUF`.

## The mount service

`MOUNT` and `VOLS` on the starter card are programs. They change and list the
drives through the mount service, `VOLSVC`, which a program reaches through
the jump `ABIVOL` at `C00Fh` (`src/abi.asm:14`, `src/vol.asm:578-584`). It has
three functions, chosen by `A`:

- `A` = 0 mounts the volume at container index `E` on drive `C`.
- `A` = 1 unmounts drive `C`.
- `A` = 2 copies the descriptor at index `E` to the 32 bytes at `HL`, with its
  drive byte replaced by the drive the volume is on now, `FFh` for none.

Each returns `A` = 0, or `FFh` with nothing changed. A mount fails in four
cases: an index past the table, a drive past D, a volume already on a drive
and a drive whose vector slot is too small for the volume. An unmount fails
for drive A, which is never left empty (`src/vol.asm:611-676`). The slot rule
is `VSLOT`'s. A volume of 4,096 blocks or more, a G8M, needs a 256-byte slot,
and any other needs a slot of either size (`src/vol.asm:638-651`). Chapter 13
describes how cold boot gives out the slots.

Before a mount or unmount changes a drive, `VFLUSH` writes every changed line
of the block cache to the card, with interrupts off. The service fails if any
write fails, so that a volume's data is on the card before the volume leaves
its drive (`src/vol.asm:678-690`). A mount then clears the drive's old entry,
fills the new one and its DPH with `MNONE`, and records the index. An unmount
clears the entry. Either way the service ends by marking `BLKBUF` empty and
calling BDOS function 37 to reset the drive. The drive's next access then logs
it in from its new directory (`src/vol.asm:662-674`).

The service writes nothing of its own to the card. The card's header still
names its own drives, and a power-off, or a reset whose kept selection no
longer matches, brings them back.

The run below shows the slot rule on the starter card. It is a format 1.0 card
whose two drives have vector slots, and whose C and D have none.
`MOUNT C: WORK` fails first because `WORK` is on B, and again after B is
unmounted because C has no slot. `MOUNT B: WORK` puts it back, and `VOLS`
lists the container through the describe function:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs "MOUNT C: WORK" "MOUNT B:" "MOUNT C: WORK" "MOUNT B: WORK" VOLS -->
```text
A>MOUNT C: WORK
Cannot mount: in use or too large

A>MOUNT B:
Unmounted

A>MOUNT C: WORK
Cannot mount: in use or too large

A>MOUNT B: WORK
B: WORK       

A>VOLS
00 SYSTEM      G1M A:
01 WORK        G8M B:

A>
```

A card of format 1.1 with a drive count of 4 gives each of A to D a 256-byte
slot at cold boot. On such a card `MOUNT C:` with a volume that is on no other
drive succeeds. The slots cost TPA: with four of them the TPA is 46,086 bytes,
768 fewer than the starter card gives.
