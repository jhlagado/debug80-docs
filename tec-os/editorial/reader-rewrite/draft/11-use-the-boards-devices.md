# 11. Use the board's devices

<!-- Checked against TEC-OS 78127ec. The programs were assembled by the starter

The BDOS handles files and console text. TEC-OS's numbered ROM calls also let
your program light the digits, sound the speaker, read the clock or write the
board's displays. A signature and version check comes before those calls so the
program can still end safely on another CP/M system.

## Numbered calls and shared ports

A hardware port is an address used by Z80 IN and OUT instructions to read or
write a device. It is separate from a memory address. Direct port writes can
affect devices TEC-OS is using at the same time.

Port `01h` selects a 7-segment digit with bits 0–5, drives the speaker with bit
7 and carries serial transmission with bit 6. Leaving bit 6 low during a digit
scan or tone sends noise on a possible console connection. The PICO9918 can also
be the console, so changing its registers can disrupt terminal output. The ROM
calls keep the serial line idle during digit and tone output and record display
claims before graphics access.

These *numbered services* are routines already in ROM. They are different from a
resident service such as `GLCD.SVC`, which is a file installed in RAM. A
numbered call selects a routine through an entry address. A resident service can
itself make such calls. Chapter 13 explains resident programs.

## The ABI and its entry address

An *application binary interface*, or ABI, specifies entry addresses, register
arguments and results that compiled programs can use. TEC-OS's fixed interface
occupies eight bytes at `C003h`, after the reset jump:

| Address | Name | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `C003h` | `ABITAB` | the letters `TNA` |
| `C006h` | `ABIMAJ` | the major version, 5 |
| `C007h` | `ABIMIN` | the minor version, 1 |
| `C008h` | `ABICALL` | a jump: the numbered services |

The three letters `TNA` are the *signature*. They distinguish this table from
unrelated bytes at the same address on another system. `ABIMAJ` and `ABIMIN`
give its ABI version, 5.1. That is separate from the ROM's product version,
which INFO reports later.

A program checks the signature and major version before calling `C008h`. The
major must be exactly 5. A new major may renumber services, while a new minor
adds numbers at the end. Code using the 5.0 calls can therefore run on 5.1. A
program requiring an added minor-version call must check that version too.

`ABICALL` is a jump into the dispatcher, not a table of separate fixed routine
addresses. The selected routines can move between builds. Their numbers,
argument contracts and the fixed ABI entry remain the interface. The reset jump
itself also has a fixed location at `C000h`.

The ROM assembles from `src/abi.inc`, whose public copy is `dist/abi.inc`. The
examples include it as `ABI.INC` for names such as ABICALL and TNLCD. These
constants define no executable bytes. `%INCLUDE` inserts the named file's
contents into the assembly source.

## Registers, status and stack

Chapter 8 introduced byte registers and register pairs. For a numbered call, C
selects the service. B is a byte argument and DE or HL can hold word values or
buffer addresses according to that service's contract. A carries no argument
because the dispatcher uses it during selection. The program calls ABICALL after
loading those inputs.

The nine hardware calls, numbers 0–8, return status in A with these flags:

| Status | Flags | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | zero set, carry clear | success |
| 1 | carry set | no such service, an argument out of range or a request rejected with nothing changed |
| 2 | carry set | the device isn't fitted or isn't the console |

`JP NZ` or `JP C` detects a hardware-call failure. The documented result
registers hold the outputs. Save any other values the program needs across the
call rather than depending on their previous contents. Hardware calls preserve
IX, IY and the alternate registers. Appendix B gives each complete register
contract.

A number from 16 upwards returns status 1 with B, DE and HL unchanged. The
hardware numbers identify these routines:

| Number | `abi.inc` | Does |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `TNINFO` | reports the board's devices, the ROM's version and the console's size |
| 1 | `TNDIGIT` | makes one pass over the six 7-segment digits |
| 2 | `TNLCD` | writes one row of the 20 × 4 LCD |
| 3 | `TNVIDEO` | claims or releases the PICO9918 |
| 4 | `TNTONE` | sounds the speaker |
| 5 | `TNJOY` | reads the joystick |
| 6 | `TNKEYS` | reads the matrix keyboard's rows |
| 7 | `TNPUTAT` | writes text at a screen position on a video console |
| 8 | `TNRTC` | reads or sets the DS1302 clock |

The other numbers extend the same ABI. Numbers 9–11 mount, unmount and describe
volumes, as Chapter 17 explains. Number 12 registers the GLCD video-driver
table. Numbers 13 and 14 find or enumerate named records in the registry
described in Chapter 13. Those registry calls have their own result convention,
including a generation in A, so their callers test carry rather than applying
the hardware status rule. Number 15 returns the ROM font and was added in ABI
5.1.

The hardware services use the caller's stack. PUTAT has the largest bound: 22
bytes below the return address supplied by CALL. That fits the inherited 30-byte
allowance from Chapter 10, but a caller must also count its own nested calls and
saved registers. Appendix B lists the individual bounds. These are bounds, not
newly measured peaks.

None of the nine hardware services calls the BDOS. They can be called from code
already inside a BDOS call, such as a BIOS-table hook. This does not apply to
every numbered service: MOUNT and UNMNT call BDOS function 37 and must be called
from outside an active BDOS call. Their register-preservation exceptions are
also listed in Appendix B.

## The shared signature check and print routines

CHKHW compares four bytes: `TNA` followed by major version 5. It returns with Z
set only when all four match. On failure the examples branch to NOTHW, which
prints a message through BDOS function 9 and ends without using a hardware port.

The examples share this complete historical `HWLIB.ASM`. It contains both code
and data, so each program includes it after its own entry code. SAY prints a
dollar-terminated string. A CALL to SAY returns to its caller while a top-level
jump to it prints and ends through the inherited return word. LABHEX prints a
label followed by A in hexadecimal. It saves A and HL across the string output.
A *nibble* is four bits, half a byte. HEX prints the two nibbles through
NIBBLE.

A *binary-coded decimal* byte, or BCD byte, stores one decimal digit in each
nibble. Printing its two nibbles as hexadecimal also displays those decimal
digits. The clock examples use that representation.

```asm
; HWLIB.ASM: routines this chapter's programs share. It goes after a
; program's own code, since it makes bytes where it is included.

; Test for TEC-OS with ABI 5. Returns Z if the table's four bytes match,

	LD	C,2
	JP	BDOS		; its RET is this routine's

```

The programs and output below are retained historical material from `78127ec`,
with the TAS/ATOM identities in the source comment. Their original assembly
syntax remains unchanged. These captures describe that build rather than a new
run of the inspected source.

## The board's report

INFO, number 0, reports device state without taking an argument. It returns B's
device bits, the ROM's version in DE and the console's size in HL. L is the
column count and H the row count. A program checks these results before using an
optional device. B's defined bits are:

| `B` bit | Value | Set when |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | `01h` | the matrix keyboard is enabled by the board's Matrix switch |
| 1 | `02h` | a PICO9918 answered at cold boot |
| 2 | `04h` | `GLCD.SVC` is in |
| 3 | `08h` | a DS1302 clock answered at cold boot |
| 4 | `10h` | the PICO9918 is claimed |
| 7 | `80h` | the ROM's word `GLCD?` is on LCD row 3 |

D holds the ROM version's major and E its minor, so `0001h` means version 0.1
rather than ABI 5.1. BOARD prints the report in hexadecimal and then calls
number 16 to demonstrate the out-of-range status:

```asm
; BOARD: print what INFO reports, then what a bad number returns.
BDOS	EQU	$0005
%INCLUDE "ABI.INC"

	ORG	$0100
	CALL	CHKHW		; the numbers below hold only on ABI 5
	JP	NZ,NOTHW

	CALL	ABICALL
	PUSH	AF		; the status, and its carry
	LD	DE,MSGBAD
	CALL	LABHEX
	POP	AF		; only the carry is wanted now
	LD	DE,MSGNC
	JP	NC,SAY		; prints and ends the program
	LD	DE,MSGC		; the carry was set
	JP	SAY		; prints and ends the program

; What each line starts with, and how the last ends.
MSGB:	DB	"Devices  B = $"
MSGVER:	DB	13,10,"Version DE = $"
MSGCOL:	DB	13,10,"Columns  L = $"
MSGROW:	DB	13,10,"Rows     H = $"
; The last line: the status, then its carry.
MSGBAD:	DB	13,10,"Number 16: status $"
MSGC:	DB	", carry set",13,10,"$"
MSGNC:	DB	", carry clear",13,10,"$"
%INCLUDE "HWLIB.ASM"
```

These retained host commands placed ABI.INC, HWLIB.ASM and BOARD.ASM beside each
other on a copy of the historical starter card. TAS uses the included files on
the card when it assembles BOARD:

```sh
cp dist/starter.img hw.img
node tools/tecvol.mjs put hw.img B dist/abi.inc --text
node tools/tecvol.mjs put hw.img B hwlib.asm --text
node tools/tecvol.mjs put hw.img B board.asm --text
```

Each later example's source goes on `hw.img` in the same way. `TAS BOARD` reads
BOARD.ASM on the current drive and writes BOARD.COM beside it. TAS.COM is on A,
so the program search described in Chapter 4 finds it from B. In this historical
serial-model configuration, the clock set INFO's bit 3 and the console size was
zero:

<!-- node tools/capture.mjs --card hw.img B: "TAS BOARD" BOARD -->
```text
A>B:
B>TAS BOARD
BOARD.COM written

B>BOARD
Devices  B = 08
Version DE = 0001
Columns  L = 00
Rows     H = 00
Number 16: status 01, carry set

B>
```

The historical `--board pico` model configuration includes the PICO9918,
graphics LCD and matrix keyboard. Cold boot selected the PICO console. Its
device bits were `0Bh` and its size was `50h` by `18h`, or 80 by 24. The startup
GLCD.SVC line installed nothing while PICO was the console. This is a host-model
run, not a browser capture:

<!-- node tools/capture.mjs --card hw.img --board pico B: "TAS BOARD" BOARD -->
```text
A>B:
B>TAS BOARD
BOARD.COM written

B>BOARD
Devices  B = 0B
Version DE = 0001
Columns  L = 50
Rows     H = 18
Number 16: status 01, carry set

B>
```

In the historical GLCD-only configuration, GLCD.SVC installed and became the
console. The same report gave device bits `0Dh`, columns `15h` and rows `08h`:
21 by 8.

A screen-layout program uses the size INFO returns. With a serial console, both
values are zero because TEC-OS cannot read the terminal's dimensions. The
program can use an 80-by-24 assumption, as the CCP does for pagination. A
console change can alter the values. After CON UC1 selects the graphics LCD,
INFO gives 21 by 8, so programs that change console must read them again.

## The LCD and the speaker

The 20 × 4 character LCD is separate from the console. LCD, number 2, writes
exactly 20 characters from HL to row B, numbered 0–3. Shorter messages need
space padding. B of 4 or more returns status 1 before any write. LCDMSG uses row
1 and then calls TONE, number 4, for a beep:

```asm
; LCDMSG: write a row of the 20 x 4 LCD and beep, on TEC-OS only.
BDOS	EQU	$0005
%INCLUDE "ABI.INC"

	ORG	$0100
	CALL	CHKHW		; the numbers below hold only on ABI 5
	JP	NZ,NOTHW
	LD	B,1		; the LCD's second row
	LD	HL,TEXT		; exactly 20 characters
	LD	C,TNLCD
	CALL	ABICALL		; A is the status, 0 for this row
	LD	B,120		; about 1 kHz
	LD	DE,400		; 400 half cycles, about 0.2 s
	LD	C,TNTONE
	CALL	ABICALL		; returns when the tone ends
	LD	DE,DONE
	JP	SAY		; prints and ends the program

TEXT:	DB	"Hello on the LCD    "
DONE:	DB	"Written and beeped",13,10,"$"
%INCLUDE "HWLIB.ASM"
```

The retained run requested the character LCD's rows with `--lcd`:

<!-- node tools/capture.mjs --card hw.img --lcd B: "TAS LCDMSG" LCDMSG -->
```text
A>B:
B>TAS LCDMSG
LCDMSG.COM written

B>LCDMSG
Written and beeped

B>
```

The same run's LCD text showed the message on its second row. The other rows
retained cold-boot text:

<!-- the same run's --lcd output -->
```text
TEC-OS 0.1  TEC-1G
Hello on the LCD
B: WORK
```

The row remains after program exit. On another ABI major, the signature check
takes NOTHW instead, printing `not TEC-OS with ABI 5` and leaving the character
LCD untouched.

Row 3 has a separate ownership mark for the ROM's `GLCD?` message. When GLCD.SVC
installs, TEC-OS clears that message only while the mark is set. An LCD call
writing row 3 clears the mark. Later driver installation therefore preserves the
program's replacement text. Chapter 7 explains the startup message.

TONE toggles port `01h` bit 7. B controls the delay and DE the number of half
cycles. Between ordinary toggles the delay is 16 × B + 51 T-states. A full cycle
takes two such intervals. At 4 MHz the frequency is therefore 2,000,000 divided
by that sum.

With B = 120, the interval is 1,971 T-states and the frequency is about 1,015
Hz. DE = 400 gives about 0.2 seconds, as in LCDMSG. For a duration in seconds,
the half-cycle count is frequency × 2 × seconds. B = 0 counts as 256, giving
about 482 Hz, while B = 1 gives about 29,851 Hz. DE = 0 returns immediately
without sound. These are instruction-derived relationships. Appendix B
distinguishes the final interval and call overhead.

TONE blocks until its half cycles finish, so the caller does no other work
during the sound. A nonempty tone ends with the speaker off. The routine keeps
the serial transmit line idle while driving the speaker.

## The digits and the clock

The six 7-segment digits share their segment wiring. Port `02h` sets the pattern
and port `01h` selects which digit lights. A steady-looking display requires
repeated scans, with each digit lit only during its own turn.

DIGIT, number 1, scans once through six pattern bytes at HL, leftmost first. It
turns every digit off at the end. The `60e0768` model measurement gave
20,670 T-states from the call target to return, about 5.2 ms at 4 MHz. Each
digit was lit for about 0.84 ms. The caller repeats the scan
and supplies its own number-to-segment table.

RTC, number 8, transfers seven BCD bytes through HL: seconds, minutes, hours,
date, month, weekday and year. B = 0 reads and B = 1 sets them. Setting ends
with the clock's write protection enabled. Any other B gives status 1 without
changing the clock. A failed clock probe gives status 2. INFO bit 3 separately
records whether the clock answered at cold boot.

DIGCLK repeats DIGIT and checks for a key with BDOS function 6. Every 32nd pass
it first reads the clock and converts hours, minutes and seconds into six
patterns. Its initial counter value makes the first pass read too:

```asm
; DIGCLK: the time on the 7-segment digits, until a key.

DIGS:	DB	0,0,0,0,0,0

%INCLUDE "HWLIB.ASM"
```

DIGIT leaves the digits dark between calls. Other work in the loop reduces the
time they are lit and can produce visible flicker if it takes too long. DIGCLK
does a BDOS input check each pass and a clock read every 32nd pass. When it
exits, the final DIGIT call has already turned the digits off.

NOW reads the same seven-byte clock buffer and prints its fields in date order.
The clock stores only two year digits, so this example supplies the century text
`20` itself:

```asm
; NOW: print the date and time from the clock.

NOCLK:	DB	"no clock",13,10,"$"
ENDLN:	DB	10,"$"		; after the plan's carriage return
TIME:	DS	7
%INCLUDE "HWLIB.ASM"
```

PLAN contains field-offset/separator pairs. NOW uses each offset to select a BCD
byte, prints it through HEX and then prints its separator. The historical
TAS/run capture was:

<!-- node tools/capture.mjs --card hw.img B: "TAS NOW" NOW -->
```text
A>B:
B>TAS NOW
NOW.COM written

B>NOW
2026-11-01 12:00:08 07

B>
```

That model run began with its clock at 12:00 on 1 November 2026. The clock
advances with emulated T-states, including those used while TAS assembles. Its
weekdays start at 1 for Monday, so the captured Sunday is `07`.

## The keys and the joystick

Character input reports keys one at a time. A game may instead need the matrix
switches held down during a scan. KEYS, number 6, stores eight row bytes at HL,
row 0 first, with a 1 for each pressed switch. JOY, number 5, returns active
joystick lines as 1 bits in B.

KEYS and JOY always return status 0. They do not test the Matrix switch or
report device absence. ROWS therefore checks INFO bit 0 before waiting for a
key, then prints the matrix rows and joystick byte:

```asm
; ROWS: wait for a key on the matrix keyboard, then print the eight rows
; and the joystick's byte.

The retained `--board pico` configuration has a matrix keyboard. Its `@key`
input pressed `x`, which is in row 7:

<!-- node tools/capture.mjs --card hw.img --board pico B: "TAS ROWS" "@start ROWS" "@key x" -->
```text
A>B:
B>TAS ROWS
ROWS.COM written

B>ROWS
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 08  JOY 00

B>
```

<!-- the same run with "@key 5": node tools/capture.mjs --card hw.img --board pico B: "TAS ROWS" "@start ROWS" "@key 5" -->
JOY reads port `FEh` with address line 11 low. KEYS selects row 3 in the same
way, so those inputs share wiring. In the retained alternate `5` run, the row
was `00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00  JOY 01`. A row-3 matrix key can therefore appear
as a joystick bit. A joystick line also appears in row 3, including at the
console. On the model, bit 0 types `5`. Appendix B gives the diagnostic names
for the joystick bits.

## Claiming the PICO9918

Before using PICO graphics, a program calls VIDEO, number 3, with B = 1 to claim
the chip. B = 0 releases it. Other values give status 1 without changing the
claim. When no PICO9918 answered at cold boot, both valid modes return status 2.

While the PICO is claimed, console output to it is discarded. The terminal also
suppresses its cursor and page flips. The program can set a graphics mode and
use the chip's VRAM, its video memory, through data port `BEh` and control port
`BFh`. Messages intended for the PICO must be printed before the claim or after
release. The separate character LCD remains available during the graphics work.

A release restores the ROM PICO console's mode, font and displayed page when
that console started at cold boot. If it is the selected console, the release
also clears the screen and homes the cursor. Without the matrix keyboard the
PICO console did not start, so release leaves the chip's programmed state alone.

The claim records a flag rather than an owner identity. Warm boot releases it
through the same path, so an exiting program's claim ends too. Release with no
active claim does nothing and returns status 0.

When the ROM PICO console started, it also registered a named PICO record. That
record supplies the graphics entry table listed in Appendix B. The register,
fill, write and read entries require a claim. Programs obtain the table through
the registry rather than fixed internal ROM addresses. The inspected ABI
describes version 3, including a width entry that instead requires an unclaimed
display.

FONT, number 15 in ABI 5.1, returns the ROM console font address in HL. It
contains 96 characters from `20h`, each eight bytes with the top row first. Both
display drivers use this font. Its address is a result, not a fixed address for
a program to embed.

DEMO below claims the PICO when INFO bit 1 is set, draws through the ports until
a key is received and then releases it.

## Text at a screen position

PUTAT, number 7, writes text at a position without moving the console cursor or
scrolling. B is the count, HL the character address and D/E the zero-based
row/column. It bypasses the escape-sequence parser and clips at the right edge.

A usable video console is required before any count or position succeeds.
Serial/BAT output and a claimed PICO console return status 2, even for zero
characters. On an available video console, a count of 0 returns status 0 without
reading source bytes or changing the cursor image. For a nonzero count, PUTAT
removes the cursor image before checking the row. A row below the screen writes
nothing and returns status 0. The next input wait can draw the cursor again.

PLACE writes TEC-OS at two positions. The second string has bit 7 set in each
byte so the display driver draws the reverse images:

```asm
; PLACE: write a word at two screen positions with PUTAT, plain and in
; reverse, leaving the cursor where it is.
BDOS	EQU	$0005
%INCLUDE "ABI.INC"

	ORG	$0100

	LD	HL,INVERT
	CALL	WRITE
	LD	DE,MSG		; A holds the second call's status
	CALL	LABHEX
	LD	DE,CRLF		; end the line
	JP	SAY		; prints and ends the program

	DB	$AD,$CF,$D3	; "-OS", the same
MSG:	DB	"PUTAT status $"
CRLF:	DB	13,10,"$"
%INCLUDE "HWLIB.ASM"
```

PUTAT sends bytes directly to the display routine. Both the ROM PICO console and
GLCD.SVC draw `80h–FFh` as reverse images of `00h–7Fh`. The ordinary
video-console path drops those high bytes, as Chapter 16 explains. Serial
output transmits all eight bits. This makes PUTAT a direct
route to reverse characters without an escape sequence. The retained PICO text
capture shows both strings alike because its decoder does not report reverse
presentation:

<!-- node tools/capture.mjs --card hw.img --board pico --screen B: "TAS PLACE" PLACE -->
```text

TEC-OS 0.1 for TEC-1G
A: SYSTEM
B: WORK

A>GLCD.SVC

A>B:
B>TAS PLACE
PLACE.COM written
                              TEC-OS
B>PLACE                       TEC-OS
PUTAT status 00

B>
```

In this historical 80-column run the cursor remained at the start of row 12.
PLACE's status line and the next prompt appeared beneath the positioned text.
The second copy shared row 11 with the command line.

On the 8-row graphics LCD, PLACE's row 10 is below the display, so it writes
nothing and reports status 0. On serial it reports status 2. It also reports 2
while the PICO is both claimed and the console. A claim on PICO leaves PUTAT
available on the graphics-LCD console. Portable code checks the ABI before PUTAT
and retains a BDOS path for status 2.

The `60e0768` model comparison put a PICO PUTAT character at about an eighth
of the cost of BDOS function 2. Its PUTAT figure came from one 60-character
call, with the BDOS path timed separately.
On the graphics LCD, pixel drawing dominates both paths and their costs are
close. Appendix B retains the per-cell figures and their conditions.

## DEMO

DEMO combines INFO, TONE, LCD, VIDEO, DIGIT and RTC with its own drawing code.
It reports devices, beeps with B = 120 and DE = 400 and writes all four
character-LCD rows. When INFO bit 1 is set, it claims the PICO and sets Graphics
I through the ports for colour bars and a bouncing ball.

Every 32nd loop reads the clock for LCD row 3. Each loop scans a hexadecimal
counter onto the digits, scans the LED rows, moves the ball when graphics are
active and polls for a key. On exit it sends dark digit/LED patterns and
releases an active claim.

The historical starter card did not include DEMO. The web-page recipe did
include it on A, so DEMO ran there without adding it to that card. Its source is
`test/programs/demo.asm`. Media generation exports DEMO.COM to `dist/files` and
includes it in the page recipe. The retained explicit host route used ATOM and
added the program to B of `hw.img`:

```sh
npx atom test/programs/demo.asm demo.com
node tools/tecvol.mjs put hw.img B demo.com
```

<!-- node tools/capture.mjs --card hw.img --board pico --screen "@start B:DEMO" "@key x" -->
```text
A>B:DEMO

TEC-OS hardware services demo
PICO9918: yes   GLCD: no   clock: yes

Press any key to stop.

Demo stopped.

A>
```

Here `GLCD: no` reports INFO bit 2, not the physical absence of the display. The
startup GLCD.SVC line installed nothing because PICO was the console. The
transcript contains the console bytes sent during the run. The PICO showed its
initial lines before the claim. The same run's text-screen dump after release
was:

<!-- the same run's --screen output -->
```text

Demo stopped.

A>
```

No hardware service scans the 8 × 8 LEDs. DEMO writes those ports itself, one
pass over eight rows each loop. Appendix G gives their wiring. Those ports carry
neither the serial transmit line nor console output, so those writes do not
require the shared-port state used by DIGIT or VIDEO.
