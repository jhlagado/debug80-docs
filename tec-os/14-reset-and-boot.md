# 14. Reset, cold boot and warm boot

Checked against TEC-OS 62d47ed, with the starter card's `EDIT.COM` from
Edit 845d062, whose copy on the card has the SHA-256
`ed88337e6dfa2626dd37a225a0ec09332f4927a0bde62114bbf8661d2d0fdc78`; the
timings below were measured on that card.

TEC-OS starts in two ways. Cold boot runs after power-on, after the reset
button, and when a program calls the BIOS table's first entry
(`src/boot.asm:4`), and it builds everything from nothing: page zero, the workspace, the
card's drives, the cache. Warm boot runs at the end of every program, and it
puts back only what a program may have changed, keeping the drives, the
drivers and the cache. This chapter describes cold boot from the first
instruction at `0000h` to the point where it falls into warm boot, with its
two checks of the RAM, the count of the memory regions and the test that
separates a reset from a power-on, and then warm boot as far as the CCP,
with its cost in T-states.

## The boot overlay

When the TEC-1G comes out of reset its system latch is `00h`. With bit 0 of
the latch low, the board shows the ROM's first 2 KiB at `0000h–07FFh` as
well as at `C000h–C7FFh`, and the Z80, which starts at `0000h`, runs ROM code
before any RAM has been written. The ROM's first instruction is `JP COLD`
(`src/reset.asm:5-6`), and the Z80 runs it from the copy at `0000h`. The
jump's target is an address in `C000h–FFFFh`, so the next instruction comes
from the ROM proper, and `COLD`'s first act after `DI` and loading the stack
pointer is to write `LATCLAS`, `01h`, to the latch (`src/boot.asm:9-12`).
Bit 0 high turns the copy off, `0000h–07FFh` is RAM again, and the latch now
has MAIN 0 and EXPAND 0 in view (`src/layout.asm:16`, `src/layout.asm:19`).
The Z80 comes out of reset with interrupts off. TEC-OS executes `EI` only
to restore a state it saved (`src/cache.asm:32`, `src/history.asm:39`,
`src/xmove.asm:136`): its routines that must run with interrupts off put
them back as they were at entry, so they come on only if a program enables
them. Chapter 19 describes what that costs a program that does.

## Cold boot

`COLD` is one routine, `src/boot.asm:9-54`, and the steps of a cold boot are
its lines in order:

1. `DI`, the stack at `8000h`, the latch at `LATCLAS` and interrupt mode 1
   (`src/boot.asm:9-13`).
2. `RSLCAP`, which reads what the RAM holds from before the reset, if it
   holds anything, and keeps the drive selection; it runs before anything it
   reads is cleared (`src/boot.asm:14`).
3. Page zero cleared, all 256 bytes, and `LATCHV` set to `LATCLAS`
   (`src/boot.asm:15-21`).
4. `RAMCHK`, which returns only if there is RAM at `8000h–BFFFh`
   (`src/boot.asm:22`).
5. The resident workspace cleared, from `WSBASE` to `WSEND`, and the stack
   moved to the BIOS stack inside it (`src/boot.asm:23-28`).
6. `CONINIT`, which starts the serial terminal, reads the Matrix switch and
   probes for the PICO9918, then the banner (`src/boot.asm:29-31`).
7. `LCDINIT` and the LCD's top row (`src/boot.asm:34-36`).
8. `SDINIT`, which starts the card, and `MOUNT`, which reads and checks the
   container and fills the drive table; either failure goes to the
   diagnostic prompt, `DIAG` (`src/boot.asm:37-40`).
9. `ALVINIT`, which places the allocation vectors and the BDOS entry jump,
   and `RESEL`, which applies the kept selection if the card still has it
   (`src/boot.asm:41-42`).
10. `PZTOP`, the top of the TPA, set to the BDOS entry jump, since no driver
    is loaded yet (`src/boot.asm:43-44`).
11. The BIOS jump table copied from the ROM to `BF00h` (`src/boot.asm:45-48`).
12. The volumes printed on the console and on the LCD (`src/boot.asm:49-50`).
13. Drive A and user 0 at `0004h`, and page zero built by `PZINIT`
    (`src/boot.asm:51-53`).
14. `MEMINIT`, which counts the MAIN and EXPAND regions and clears EXPAND 1
    (`src/boot.asm:54`). When it returns, cold boot runs on into warm boot,
    the next routine in the file.

The order follows from what each step needs. The reset test comes first
because the steps after it clear the memory it reads. The workspace is
cleared only after the RAM check, since until then it may not be RAM, and the
stack moves into it only after it is cleared. Step 11 runs at cold boot only,
for the reason Chapter 15 gives. Chapter 18 describes steps 8 and 9, and the
rest of this chapter steps 2, 4 and 14.

The diagnostic prompt's `R` jumps back to `COLDRT`, step 7
(`src/diag.asm:22-23`, `src/boot.asm:32-34`). A retry clears the LCD, starts
the card again and mounts it, without clearing the memory or printing the
banner a second time.

On the starter card with the serial board, cold boot takes 1,279,382
T-states from the first instruction to the CCP's entry, about 0.32 seconds,
measured on the host model. Three steps take most of it: the banner, 25
characters at 9,372 T-states each through `CONOUT`; the read of the
container's block 0, 219,137 T-states; and `MEMINIT`, about 347,000, most
of it the clearing of EXPAND 1. The startup file's commands then run before
the first prompt. The CCP's first call of `CONIN` at that prompt comes
8,907,139 T-states after reset.

## The two RAM checks

TEC-OS needs RAM at `8000h–BFFFh`, because its workspace and stacks are there,
and it needs both halves of U9, because EXPAND 1 holds the cache.

The first check, `RAMCHK`, runs before anything has been printed, on the
boot stack in fixed RAM (`src/boot.asm:291-309`). It writes `55h` at `8000h`
and `AAh` at `BFFFh`, then reads both back, and does it again with the
patterns swapped. Both ends are written before either is read, so that a
board with nothing in U9, whose data bus floats, can't return the byte just
written from the bus itself (`src/boot.asm:292-294`). If either byte is
wrong, `RAMBAD` sends `TEC-OS needs 64K RAM` to the serial port and stops in
a loop (`src/boot.asm:311-320`). It calls the transmit routine `TXBYTE`
directly, since the console isn't started yet and that routine uses only the
port and the stack.

The second check is in `MEMINIT`, near the end of cold boot, and it looks for
EXPAND 1 (`src/boot.asm:143-148`). It uses `DETECT`, the same routine that
counts MAIN regions. If the count is not 2, it jumps to the same `RAMBAD`, and
the same message goes to the serial port after the volumes have been printed.
`EXPANDS` at `0044h` therefore always holds 2 once cold boot has finished
(`src/layout.asm:41`).

## Counting MAIN and EXPAND

`DETECT` tests whether setting a given latch bit puts different RAM at a
given address (`src/boot.asm:185-213`). It reads the byte at the
address with the bit clear, sets the bit and reads the byte again, then
writes the complement of the first byte and clears the bit. If the byte read
now, with the bit clear, is no longer the first byte, the write landed in
the same RAM, so the bit selects nothing and there is one region. If the
byte is unchanged, the write went to other RAM, and there are two. Each byte
is put back as it was, and the routine returns 1 or 2 with the latch values
without and with the bit in `D` and `E`. Nothing is pushed while the bit is
set, because the stack itself may be in the RAM the bit replaces.

`MEMINIT` tests EXPAND at `8000h` with `LATEXP`, and MAIN at `0100h` with
`LATMAIN` (`src/layout.asm:21-22`, `src/boot.asm:143-171`). With EXPAND 1
found, it uses `DETECT`'s latch value to put EXPAND 1 in view, clears all
16 KiB of it, fills the cache's 120 bytes of line addresses with `FFh`, which
marks every line empty, and puts EXPAND 0 back (`src/boot.asm:149-162`). It
sets EXPAND 1's low mark to `80h`, which closes it to programs' copies
(`src/boot.asm:163-165`). The count of MAIN regions goes to `MAINS` at
`0041h`, which the table at `C00Dh` points at. With a second MAIN, `MNCOPY`
copies page zero into it, a byte at a time, switching the latch between each
read and its write (`src/boot.asm:172-183`), so that MAIN 1's `0000h` also
jumps to the RAM BIOS table.

## The reset test

The TEC-1G's reset button and its power-on reset the Z80 in the same way.
The difference is in the RAM: after power-on it holds whatever the chips came
up with, and after the button it still holds what TEC-OS left there.
TEC-OS uses that to keep one thing across a reset, the selection of volumes
on the drives, so that a reset of a board whose drives were changed with
`MOUNT` comes back with the same drives. The test is `RSLCAP`
(`src/boot.asm:84-138`), and it reads only page zero, the word `STUBAD`, the
three bytes at the address that word holds and the drive table, and it runs
none of the code it reads. The RAM passes it when all of these hold:

- `0000h` holds a `JP` to `BF03h`, the RAM BIOS table's warm boot entry;
- `0005h` holds a `JP`;
- the word in `STUBAD`, the address where cold boot put the BDOS entry jump,
  is an address of the form `xx06h`, and the three bytes there are
  `JP BENTRY`, the BDOS entry of this ROM;
- the word at `0006h` is of the form `xx06h`, at least `8000h`, and no
  higher than `STUBAD`'s page.

The last condition allows for drivers, which lower the word at `0006h`, and
the word is not compared with `PZTOP`, so that a reset pressed to recover
from a driver's `INIT` that hung still passes (`src/boot.asm:88-89`). The
test depends on two addresses of this build, `STUBAD`'s own and `BENTRY`, and
RAM left by a build with either one elsewhere fails it
(`src/boot.asm:90-91`). A reset whose RAM passes the test is a recognised
reset; any other reset gives the card's own drives. Cold boot clears
page zero at its start and writes its jumps again only at step 13, so a reset
pressed during cold boot before that step, or at the diagnostic prompt, fails
the test too.

When the RAM passes, `RSLCAP` copies the drive table, 32 bytes, to `RSLBUF`
at `0100h` in the TPA (`src/boot.asm:131-135`, `src/layout.asm:89-95`).
Nothing writes there between `COLD` and `MEMINIT`, so the copy survives the
clearing of the workspace and is still there for the diagnostic prompt's
retry. When the RAM fails, `RSLCAP` puts 0 in drive A's geometry byte in
`RSLBUF`, which means no selection (`src/boot.asm:136-138`).

The selection is applied by `RESEL`, after `MOUNT` has accepted the card in
the socket and `ALVINIT` has given its drives their vectors in the usual way
(`src/vol.asm:391-480`). It works in two steps. The first reads and changes
nothing in the drive table: it walks the card's descriptors and compares
each with every kept drive on the eight bytes a drive-table entry holds, the
start, the length, the geometry and the flags. A descriptor goes to the first
kept drive it matches, and the volume must fit that drive's vector slot. If a
read fails, a matching volume would not fit its slot, or a kept drive is left
with no match, `RESEL` returns and the card's own drives stand. Only when
every kept drive has matched does the second step copy `RSLBUF` over the
drive table and the drives' indexes and build each drive's DPH; it reads
nothing and can't fail. A drive that was empty before the reset stays empty,
even if the card names a volume for it (`src/vol.asm:402-404`).

The run below unmounts drive B with `MOUNT B:`, then presses reset. The kept
selection has no volume on B, the starter card's two volumes still match, and
after the reset only A is listed:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs "MOUNT B:" "@reset" -->
```text
A>MOUNT B:
Unmounted

A>
TEC-OS 0.1 for TEC-1G
A: SYSTEM     

A>PICO.DRV
PICO.DRV?

A>GLCD.DRV
GLCD.DRV?

A>
```

The selection is all that a reset keeps. Cold boot clears page zero, the
workspace and EXPAND 1 as on any cold boot, so drivers, the registry, the
cache, open files and the history are gone, and the console is the serial
terminal again (`src/boot.asm:15-28`, `src/boot.asm:149-155`). A change the
cache held for the card is lost. Once a recognised reset has applied a
selection, the next reset passes the test again while the card still holds
those volumes, so only losing the RAM returns the drives to the card's own
choice; `docs/recovery.md` sets out these limits for the user.

## Page zero

`PZINIT` writes page zero's fixed parts at the end of cold boot and again at
every warm boot (`src/boot.asm:215-265`). It puts `JP BF03h` at `0000h`, a
`JP` at `0005h` to `PZTOP`, and `JP BENTRY` at the address in `STUBAD`; it
writes `EI` and `RETI` at `0038h`, where interrupt mode 1 and `RST 38h` go;
and it rewrites the restart vectors at `0008h–0037h`. A vector that jumps
into the ROM keeps its jump and has the rest of its eight bytes zeroed. Any
other becomes seven zeros and a `RET`, so that an `RST` through it returns
at once with the interrupt state unchanged, and a vector that a program
pointed into the TPA does not outlive the program (`src/boot.asm:235-265`).
The IOBYTE at `0003h` and the drive and user byte at `0004h` are left as they
are. Chapter 13 lists page zero in full.

## Warm boot

Warm boot is `WBOOTR`, `src/boot.asm:56-82`. It is the second entry of the
BIOS table, and the jump at `0000h` leads to it through the RAM table at
`BF03h`. A program reaches it by returning from `0100h`, since the CCP
pushes `0000h` before it jumps there (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:14`,
`src/cpm/ccp.asm:297-300`), by jumping to `0000h`, by calling BDOS function 0
(`src/cpm/bdos.asm:132-133`), or by a call of BDOS function 47 that succeeds
(`src/cpm/bdos.asm:65-71`). The BDOS goes there itself, through `CHDROP`,
which first drops the rest of a chained line, a line split at `!` (Chapter
11; `src/cpm/bdos.asm:75-77`), after a `^C` typed as the first key of a line
read with function 10 (`src/cpm/bdos.asm:371-375`) and after it has reported
a disk error such as `Bdos Err On B: Select` (`src/cpm/bdos.asm:2434-2437`,
`src/cpm/bdos.asm:2453-2456`). A `^C` at the prompt is the first case, since
the CCP reads its line with function 10:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs ^C -->
```text
A>^C
A>
```

Warm boot's steps are:

1. `DI`, then EXPAND 1 in view, and `JP WBOOTR` written at `BF03h` in EXPAND
   1 (`src/boot.asm:59-65`). The jump is for a program that ends with
   EXPAND 1 in view: its jump to `0000h` reaches `BF03h` in EXPAND 1, where
   this jump is.
2. The latch and `LATCHV` set to `LATCLAS`, which puts MAIN 0 and EXPAND 0
   back, and the stack set to the BIOS stack (`src/boot.asm:66-69`). The
   latch comes before the stack because the BIOS stack is in EXPAND 0.
3. `PZINIT`, as above (`src/boot.asm:70`).
4. `DRVBSY` cleared, so that a driver's `INIT` or `REMOVE` that a program's
   end interrupted is not taken to be still running (`src/boot.asm:71-72`).
5. `CPMINIT`, which clears the CCP's working memory and the BDOS's state,
   331 bytes from `CCPCLR` to `BDOSRME`, as a fresh load of them from disk
   would leave it, keeps the command buffer below `CCPCLR` for a chained
   line's next piece, puts the DMA address back at `0080h`, sets the command
   buffer's maximum length to 127, fills the CCP stack's guard with `A5h` and
   marks the deblocking buffer empty so that a changed card is read again
   (`src/boot.asm:270-289`, `src/ram.asm:68-81`).
6. The console put right: `HWVREL` gives back the PICO9918 if a program
   claimed it, `VREST` restores the video display's mode if the console is
   on one, and `VTREGR` resets the scroll region to the whole screen
   (`src/boot.asm:74-78`).
7. `CWBOOT`, which writes every changed line of the cache to the card and,
   if any write has failed since the last warm boot, prints `Write lost` and
   drops the rest of a chained line (`src/boot.asm:79`,
   `src/cache.asm:347-358`).
8. A jump to the CCP's entry, `CCPENT`, with `C` holding the drive and user
   byte from `0004h` (`src/boot.asm:80-82`).

Warm boot leaves the rest alone. The drive table, the DPHs and `LOGINV`, the
BDOS's record of the logged-in drives, are in the BIOS's part of the
workspace, which `CPMINIT` does not clear (`src/ram.asm:22-34`); the
allocation vectors below `WSBASE` and the BIOS table at `BF00h` are outside
what it clears too. The two FCBs and the command buffer, the 202 bytes of the
CCP's RAM below `CCPCLR`, are outside it as well, and so is `CHPOS`, the byte
above the BIOS table that marks a chained line's next piece, so the rest of
the line outlives the warm boot (`src/ram.asm:68-81`, `src/ram.asm:240`), as
Chapter 25 describes. The drivers below the BDOS entry, the registry's head
and the video drivers' tables above the BIOS table, and the cache's lines and
the history in EXPAND 1 are kept too.

The CCP's entry does the rest (`src/cpm/ccp.asm:29-66`). It sets its stack,
puts A: in place of a drive past D: or with no volume, since selecting one
would give a `Select` error and a warm boot back to the same place
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:33-44`), and sets `WRFLAG` before it calls BDOS function
13, the disk reset. With that flag set, function 13 keeps each logged-in
drive whose vector nothing has changed since it was last built and that still
sums as it did then; a drive that a write has changed is marked to be
rebuilt, at its next selection, from its directory entries up to the highest
one in use; any other is dropped and is scanned in full when it is next
selected (`src/cpm/bdos.asm:481-542`). A program's own call of function 13 has no flag
set and drops every drive, as CP/M 2.2 does. The CCP then sets the user
number from the byte it was given, calls `STBOOT`, which starts the startup
file once after a cold boot (Chapter 22 describes it), and selects the drive
if it is not A. Its main loop then takes a chained line's next piece, if one
is left, before the startup file's next line and before the console
(`src/cpm/ccp.asm:80-84`).

## The cost of a warm boot

On the starter card with the serial board, warm boot takes 31,455 T-states,
about 8 milliseconds, from the first instruction of `WBOOTR` to the CCP's
label `STARTED`, where it starts printing the prompt. That figure was
measured on the host model with nothing changed since the last warm boot. It
reads no block. Of it, `CPMINIT` takes 7,427 T-states, the cache's flush in
`CWBOOT`, with no line to write, 8,002, and the CCP's entry with its disk
reset 13,828.

A warm boot after `SAVE 8 X.COM` on drive A takes 119,508 T-states on the
same measure. The extra 88,000 or so are the rebuild of A's vector from its
directory up to the last entry in use, read from the block cache with no
card access. For comparison, a disk reset of the kind a program makes, which
drops drive A and scans its whole directory again, takes 1,035,496 T-states
on the starter card even with the directory in the cache, and the first scan
of drive B's 512 entries, with the card read for each of its 32 directory
blocks, takes 9,163,477. The test `test/warmboot.test.mjs` checks the
unchanged case on its own card: a warm boot that reads no block and takes at
most 386,604 T-states (`test/warmboot.test.mjs:11-17`).
