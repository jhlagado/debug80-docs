# 11. Chaining commands

Checked against TEC-OS 08da4d6, with the starter card's `EDIT.COM` from Edit
845d062, whose copy on the card has the SHA-256
`ed88337e6dfa2626dd37a225a0ec09332f4927a0bde62114bbf8661d2d0fdc78`.

A command line in TEC-OS can hold more than one command, with `!` between them.
The CCP runs them in turn, each after the one before has ended, whether that was
a built-in or a program. A command written with `:` in front runs only if the
one before it succeeded, and a program reports success or failure through a
return code that it sets with BDOS function 108. A program can also end by
handing the CCP a new command line, with BDOS function 47. CP/M 2.2 runs one
command per line, but TEC-OS takes these rules from CP/M 3's CCP. Chapter 25
describes the code behind them.

## Several commands on one line

`!` between two commands runs the first and then the second. Each command
after the first is echoed after its own prompt, so the screen reads as if you
had typed the commands one at a time:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs "DIR *.CMD!TYPE STARTUP.CMD" "vols!!  ! dir b:!" -->
```text
A>DIR *.CMD!TYPE STARTUP.CMD
STARTUP.CMD 
1 file, 986K free
A>TYPE STARTUP.CMD
PICO.DRV
GLCD.DRV

A>vols!!  ! dir b:!
00 SYSTEM      G1M A:
01 WORK        G8M B:

A>dir b:
NO FILE
A>
```

The part of a line between two `!`, or between a `!` and an end of the line,
is a *piece*. The second line shows the CCP passing over an empty piece, a
piece of spaces and a `!` at the end, so `vols!!  ! dir b:!` is two commands. A
line of nothing but spaces and `!` runs nothing. The CCP turns each piece into
capitals as it takes it to run, but the echo of a piece is as you typed it, so
`dir b:` stays in lower case on the screen.

A piece is a whole command, and whatever it changes holds for the pieces
after it, so a drive change or a `USER` command in one piece is the drive or
user area of the next:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs "B:!COPY A:STARTUP.CMD NOTES.TXT!DIR" -->
```text
A>B:!COPY A:STARTUP.CMD NOTES.TXT!DIR
B>COPY A:STARTUP.CMD NOTES.TXT
COPIED 0001

B>DIR
NOTES.TXT   
1 file, 8172K free
B>
```

`NOTES.TXT`, with no drive, was made on drive B, because the first piece had
made B the current drive. A program in a piece starts as it would from a line
of its own: the CCP gives it the command tail and the two FCBs of Chapter 6
from its own piece. The tail ends at the `!` after the piece, so the pieces
that follow aren't in the tail, and no command or argument can hold a `!`.

The whole line holds up to 127 characters, as a typed line does, so a line of
32 commands of three letters each, with 31 `!`, fits. The history of Chapter 3
stores the line once, whole and as typed, and `^W` brings it back to run again.

A line of `STARTUP.CMD` may hold `!` as well, and its pieces all run before the
startup file's next line. A startup line's characters after the 127th are
passed over, as a typed line can't hold more.

## A command that depends on the one before

A piece that starts with `:` runs only if the command before it succeeded. If
that command failed, the `:` piece is echoed and nothing runs, and the rest of
the line is dropped, the pieces without `:` after it included:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs "NOSUCH!:DIR *.CMD!DIR *.DRV" "DIR *.DRV!:DIR *.CMD" ":DIR *.CMD" -->
```text
A>NOSUCH!:DIR *.CMD!DIR *.DRV
NOSUCH?

A>:DIR *.CMD
A>DIR *.DRV!:DIR *.CMD
PICO.DRV     PICO40.DRV   PICO32.DRV   GLCD.DRV    
4 files, 986K free
A>:DIR *.CMD
STARTUP.CMD 
1 file, 986K free
A>:DIR *.CMD
STARTUP.CMD 
1 file, 986K free
A>
```

`NOSUCH` isn't a command, so `:DIR *.CMD` didn't run and `DIR *.DRV` after it
was dropped with the rest of the line. In the second line `DIR *.DRV`
succeeded and `:DIR *.CMD` ran. The third line starts with `:`, and the
command it tests is the last one of the line before, the `DIR *.CMD` that
succeeded. A `:` at the start of a line typed after a failure runs nothing. On
the serial board and on the web page's board, the starter card's last
startup line `GLCD.DRV` fails, so a `:` that starts the first line typed runs
nothing there too.

## Return codes

Success and failure are one 16-bit number, the program return code of CP/M 3.
BDOS function 108 sets and reads it, and the CCP tests it for `:`. The code is
a failure when it is from `FF00h` to `FFFEh`, and any other value is a
success. A call with `DE` set to `FFFFh` returns the code in `HL`, and a call
with any other `DE` sets the code to it, so `FFFFh` itself can't be set, and it
counts as a success.

The CCP sets the code to 0 as it takes each piece, after testing a `:` and
before it looks for the command. A program that reads the code when it starts
always finds 0, since the CCP cleared it before loading the program. A built-in
that succeeds leaves the code at 0, and so does a program that never calls
function 108, so an ordinary CP/M 2.2 program always succeeds. The code is also
0 after a reset.

The CCP sets the code to `FF00h` when a command fails at the CCP. That covers a
command that isn't found, a program that won't load and a driver that won't
install. It also covers every built-in that prints `NAME?`, `NO FILE`,
`FILE EXISTS`, `NO SPACE` or one of `COPY`'s messages. An `ERA *.*` answered
with `N` erases nothing and is a success.

A program sets the code to report on its own work. This one, `EXISTS`, fails
when the file named on its command line isn't there and succeeds when it is:

```asm
; EXISTS: a failure, return code FF00h, when the file named on the command
; line isn't there.
BDOS    EQU     $0005

        ORG     $0100
        LD      DE,$005C        ; the FCB the CCP filled from the tail
        LD      C,15            ; BDOS function 15: open the file
        CALL    BDOS
        INC     A               ; A = FFh: no such file
        RET     NZ              ; it is there: the code stays 0
        LD      DE,$FF00        ; a failure
        LD      C,108           ; BDOS function 108: set the return code
        CALL    BDOS
        RET
```

Function 15 opens the file whose FCB is at `DE` and returns `FFh` in `A` when
there is no such file, as Chapter 6 describes. `EXISTS` prints nothing, and
its result is the code. This program goes in the clone as `exists.asm`, beside
the next section's `run.asm`. These commands assemble both and put them on
drive B of a copy of the starter card:

```sh
npx atom exists.asm exists.com
npx atom run.asm run.com
cp dist/starter.img chain.img
node tools/tecvol.mjs put chain.img B exists.com
node tools/tecvol.mjs put chain.img B run.com
```

`EXISTS NOTES.TXT!:TYPE NOTES.TXT` then types `NOTES.TXT` only if it is
there. Here the line runs once before `NOTES.TXT` is made and once after:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs --card chain.img B: "EXISTS NOTES.TXT!:TYPE NOTES.TXT!DIR" "COPY A:STARTUP.CMD NOTES.TXT" "EXISTS NOTES.TXT!:TYPE NOTES.TXT!DIR" -->
```text
A>B:
B>EXISTS NOTES.TXT!:TYPE NOTES.TXT!DIR

B>:TYPE NOTES.TXT
B>COPY A:STARTUP.CMD NOTES.TXT
COPIED 0001

B>EXISTS NOTES.TXT!:TYPE NOTES.TXT!DIR

B>:TYPE NOTES.TXT
PICO.DRV
GLCD.DRV

B>DIR
EXISTS.COM   RUN.COM      NOTES.TXT   
3 files, 8164K free
B>
```

The blank line after each `EXISTS` is the CCP's, which starts a new line
after every program. The first time, `EXISTS` failed, and `:TYPE NOTES.TXT`
and the `DIR` after it were dropped. The second time both ran.

A piece without `:` runs whatever the command before it returned, so a
failure stops the line only at a piece that starts with `:`:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs --card chain.img B: "EXISTS NONE.TXT!DIR" "EXISTS NONE.TXT" ":DIR" "USER 0" ":DIR" -->
```text
A>B:
B>EXISTS NONE.TXT!DIR

B>DIR
EXISTS.COM   RUN.COM     
2 files, 8168K free
B>EXISTS NONE.TXT

B>:DIR
B>USER 0
B>:DIR
EXISTS.COM   RUN.COM     
2 files, 8168K free
B>
```

`USER 0`, a built-in that succeeded, set the code back to 0, and the second
`:DIR` ran.

## A program that starts another

A program can end by giving the CCP a command line to run next, with BDOS
function 47, which CP/M 3 calls *chain to program*. The program puts the line
in memory, ended by a 0 byte, sets the DMA address (Chapter 6) to it with
function 26 and calls function 47. When the line is accepted the call doesn't
return: TEC-OS copies the line and ends the program with a warm boot, and the
CCP then runs the line next, in place of whatever was left of the line the
program came from. This program, `RUN`, ends by running the rest of its own
command line as a command:

```asm
; RUN: end by running the rest of the command line as a command.
BDOS    EQU     $0005

        ORG     $0100
        LD      DE,$0081        ; the command tail, ended by a 0
        LD      C,26            ; BDOS function 26: set the DMA address
        CALL    BDOS
        LD      C,47            ; BDOS function 47: chain to the command
        CALL    BDOS
        LD      DE,NOTRUN       ; back here only if it was rejected
        LD      C,9
        CALL    BDOS
        RET
NOTRUN: DB      "Not run",13,10,"$"
```

The CCP puts a 0 after the command tail at `0081h`, so the tail is a line ready
for function 47, with the space before its first word, which the CCP passes
over. `RUN DIR` therefore runs `DIR`. A line from function 47 takes the place
of what was left of the line, so in `RUN A:VOLS!DIR` the `DIR` never runs:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs --card chain.img B: "RUN DIR" "RUN A:VOLS!DIR" "RUN NOSUCH!DIR" "RUN" -->
```text
A>B:
B>RUN DIR

B>DIR
EXISTS.COM   RUN.COM     
2 files, 8168K free
B>RUN A:VOLS!DIR

B>A:VOLS
00 SYSTEM      G1M A:
01 WORK        G8M B:

B>RUN NOSUCH!DIR

B>NOSUCH
NOSUCH?

B>RUN

B>
```

The chained command is echoed after the prompt, as a piece is. A command
from function 47 that isn't found, or doesn't load, fails as a typed one
does, with its name and a question mark. `RUN` alone chains an empty line,
which ends the program and runs nothing, and the prompt comes back.

The line may be up to 127 characters, and it may hold `!` and `:`, which the
CCP treats as in a typed line. A `:` at its start tests the code the program
set before the call. The line is copied as soon as the function is called, so
it may be anywhere in memory, even where the next program loads. CP/M 3's
function 47 also reads register `E`, but TEC-OS doesn't read it. The chained
command runs on the drive and in the user area held in the byte at `0004h`, as
any command after a program's end does.

Function 47 rejects a line with no 0 in its first 128 bytes, or with a carriage
return or a line feed before the 0. It then returns with `A = FFh`, the program
goes on and the line it came from is unchanged. In `RUN`, the message `Not run`
would follow, but a tail can hold neither character, so `RUN` itself never
prints it.

A program started from a line of `STARTUP.CMD` may chain too, and the
chained line runs before the startup file's next line.

## The end of a chained line

These events drop what is left of a line:

- a `:` piece after a failure
- a call to function 47, whose line replaces the rest
- `^C` typed while a line that a program reads with BDOS function 10 is
  empty
- the key that ends a BDOS error, such as `Bdos Err On C: Select`
- a reset

After function 47 its own line runs in place of the rest. After a reset TEC-OS
starts again from the startup file. After the others the CCP prints the prompt
and waits for a new line. Here the BDOS error for a drive with no volume,
ended by the key `x`, drops the `VOLS` after it:

<!-- node book/capture.mjs "@start DIR C:!VOLS" "@key x" -->
```text
A>DIR C:!VOLS

Bdos Err On C: Select
A>
```

Other ways a command can end leave the rest of the line to run. A program that
prints its own error message and returns has succeeded unless it set the code.
A key that ends a `TYPE` or `DIR` listing at `[more]` lets the line's next
piece run, as it does after a listing that ran to its end. Those keys are
`^C`, Esc and `Q`, and also `#` and `;`. The last two differ from `^C` and Esc
only in the bit the key test clears. A `Write lost` message at a warm boot,
which Chapter 4 describes, also leaves the rest of the line to run.
