# 23. Diagnostics

Checked against TEC-OS 5a25178. The diagnostics ROM in this chapter is version
0.2, image `D90143609F53FAAB`, as `npm run diag` builds it from that commit.

Two parts of the repository report what is wrong with a board. The TEC-OS ROM
itself stops at a diagnostic prompt when cold boot can't mount the card, and the
diagnostics ROM, built from `diag/`, is a separate image that tests each part of
the board TEC-OS uses and prints a report. This chapter describes the prompt,
then follows the diagnostics ROM from its build to a report from a board.
Chapter 1 shows the prompt from the user's side, and Chapter 18 shows the
container's checks. Appendix D gives every error code
with its remedy.

## The diagnostic prompt

Cold boot sets up the LCD and the card at `COLDRT` (`src/boot.asm:51`). It
starts the card with `SDINIT` and checks the container with `MOUNT`, and a
failure of either jumps to `DIAG` with an error code in `A`
(`src/boot.asm:54-57`). The code is one of `SDINIT`'s, `01h` to `04h`, or one of
`MOUNT`'s, `20h` to `2Ah` (`src/sd.asm:10-13`, `src/vol.asm:8-18`). The banner is
printed before the card is touched (`src/boot.asm:46-47`), so it appears
whatever the card holds. Only the RAM check comes before it. `RAMCHK` writes
and reads back the bytes at `8000h` and `BFFFh` and looks for EXPAND 1 behind
the window, and a board that lacks either prints `TEC-OS needs 64K RAM` on the
serial port and stops there (`src/boot.asm:33`, `src/boot.asm:290-320`,
`src/text.asm:5`). After the banner `MEMINIT` empties the block cache's lines,
before the first mount reads the container's table through a line
(`src/boot.asm:48`).

`DIAG` resets the stack to the BIOS's, since a mount that failed part way may
have left it deep, and keeps the code on it (`src/boot.asm:423-424`). It writes
`CARD?` on the LCD's last row (`src/boot.asm:425-426`, `src/text.asm:10`,
`src/lcd.asm:43`) and then prints `No volume mounted, error ` and the code as
two hexadecimal digits (`src/boot.asm:427-431`, `src/text.asm:8`).

At the prompt `R retry> ` (`src/text.asm:9`), `DIAG` reads one key with
`BCONIN`, turns a small letter into a capital, echoes it and ends the line
(`src/boot.asm:432-439`). Any key but `R` gives the prompt again
(`src/boot.asm:442`). The console at this point is always the serial terminal.
Cold boot starts it there, and no display driver has been installed, since the
startup file is on the card. So on a board with no terminal attached, the LCD's
`CARD?` is the only sign.

`R` jumps back to `COLDRT` (`src/boot.asm:440-441`). That starts the LCD again,
which clears `CARD?`, and then repeats the card's start and the mount, so a card
fixed or put in while the prompt waits is mounted without a reset. `MOUNT`
reads each block of the table from the card again, whatever a line holds
(`src/vol.asm:23-26`).

The retry keeps a selection of volumes carried over from a recognised reset,
which Chapter 14 explains. `RSLCAP` copies the drive table to `RSLBUF` before
cold boot clears anything (`src/boot.asm:25`). `RSLBUF` is at `0100h`, in the
fixed RAM (`src/layout.asm:92`), and nothing on the path from there to the
prompt writes it: `MEMINIT` clears EXPAND 1 alone, and the mount reads the
table into a line in EXPAND 1 (`src/boot.asm:48`, `src/boot.asm:150-166`,
`src/vol.asm:251-281`).

## The diagnostics ROM

The diagnostics ROM is a second 16 KiB image for `C000h–FFFFh`, made to be
burned in place of TEC-OS. It tests the board, and it needs no card, no
console driver and no TEC-OS. One command builds it:

```sh
npm run diag
```

```text
diag: ROM 16318/16384 bytes, 56 free, image D90143609F53FAAB, checksum $47C0
```

`tools/diag.mjs` generates two files (`tools/diag.mjs:51-77`).
`diag/gen/config.asm` holds the version, the serial delay counts and the
stopwatch constants, and `diag/gen/font.asm` comes from `format/font5x7.txt`,
the same font file TEC-OS's display drivers use. The serial delays are worked
out from 4 MHz and 4800 baud as for TEC-OS (`tools/diag.mjs:37-49`). The script
then assembles `diag/diag.asm` with ATOM, fills the unused bytes with `FFh` and
writes `build/diag/diag.rom`, its symbol map and `build/diag/diag.json`
(`tools/diag.mjs:90-133`).

Two values in the image identify it, so that a report names the image that
produced it and a test can check the ROM on the board. The image ID is the first
8 bytes of the SHA-256 of the image with its last 10 bytes, `FFF6h–FFFFh`, set
to `FFh` (`tools/diag.mjs:25-28`, `tools/diag.mjs:83-88`). The build stores it
at `FFF6h` (`tools/diag.mjs:115`), and the banner and the report both print it.
The last two bytes, at `FFFEh`, hold the 16-bit sum of `C000h–FFFDh`
(`tools/diag.mjs:116-119`), which test T05 checks on the board.

The build checks the image before writing it (`tools/diag.mjs:104-108`). The
reset entry must be at `C000h` and the interrupt entries at `C038h` and
`C066h`. Cold boot and the first RAM check must lie in the first 2 KiB, which
is all the board shows at `0000h` after a reset.

The ROM starts as TEC-OS does. At reset the board's boot overlay shows the first
2 KiB of the ROM at `0000h`, and the code there jumps to `COLD` at its `C000h`
address and turns the overlay off (`diag/boot.asm:8-27`). `COLD` first puts a
`RETN` at `0066h`, so that an NMI returns at once, and then turns off the
digits, the speaker, the 8 × 8 LEDs and the SD card (`diag/boot.asm:29-40`).

The ROM's own variables are at `7E00h–7EFFh` and its stack at `7F00h–7FFFh`,
in the fixed RAM (`diag/defs.asm:43-44`). Every later test depends on
`7E00h–7FFFh`, so test T01 checks those two pages first, with no stack and
using registers alone. It makes four passes that fill them with a pattern from
each address and read them back (`diag/boot.asm:43-73`).

On a failure the ROM sends one line to the serial port, again without a stack,
from the pattern `HCTEXT` (`diag/boot.asm:127-128`). The line is
`T01 HOME    FAIL  RAM 7E00-7FFF at `, the failing address in four hexadecimal
digits, ` wrote ` and the byte written, then ` read ` and the byte read. The ROM
then waits and sends the line again, for ever (`diag/boot.asm:118-125`). The
wait is 16 passes of a 65,536-pass loop of 26 T-states, 27,262,976 T-states in
all, about 6.8 seconds at 4 MHz, so on a board the line comes back about every 7
seconds.

## The run

With those pages proved, the ROM clears its variables, installs an NMI handler
at `0066h` that counts NMIs, reads the Matrix switch and prints its banner
(`diag/main.asm:4-28`). It then waits about 5 seconds for a key
(`diag/main.asm:29-35`). `I` or `Y` selects the interactive tests as well as the
automatic ones, and anything else, or nothing, runs the automatic tests alone.
`GETKEY` takes a key from the serial port, from the hex keypad, or from the
matrix keyboard when the Matrix switch is on, with a time-out counted in half
seconds (`diag/out.asm:240-275`). On the keypad `+` reads as `Y`, `-` as `N`,
`GO` as Return and `AD` as Esc (`diag/out.asm:326`).

`tools/diag-check.mjs` runs the ROM on the host model of Chapter 25 and keeps
what the serial port printed in `build/diag` beside the image. The model has
the PICO9918, the matrix keyboard, a new card with the starter card's two
volumes, empty, and no DS1302 clock (`tools/diag-check.mjs:110-134`). One
Node.js command makes that run on its own:

```sh
node --input-type=module -e '
import { modelReport } from "./tools/diag-check.mjs";
modelReport("build/diag/diag.rom");
'
```

Its file, `build/diag/model-report-D90143609F53FAAB.txt`, starts like this:

```text


TEC-1G diagnostics 0.2 image D90143609F53FAAB
RAM 7E00-7FFF (variables and stack) passed.
Press I, Y or keypad + within 5 s to include the interactive tests.
Automatic tests only.
RAM tests take about 6 s. Keep off the keypad: its NMI would
land in the RAM under test.

-- T01 RAM 7E00h-7FFFh, before any stack use
T01 HOME    PASS  4 passes, registers only

-- T02 Fixed RAM 0000h-7DFFh, 4 pattern passes
T02 RAMLO   PASS  all bits both ways, no aliasing
```

Each test starts with `TBEGIN`, which prints `-- T`, the test's number and its
title, and shows the number and its seven-character name on the LCD's second row
(`diag/out.asm:634-657`). Each ends with one result line from `RESULT`: `T`, the
number, the name, one of six results and the details (`diag/out.asm:659-711`).
While a result line is printed, every character is also kept in the report
buffer at `1000h` (`diag/out.asm:48-62`, `diag/defs.asm:41`). The LCD's third
row shows the result and its fourth the running totals (`diag/out.asm:592-615`).

The six results are these (`diag/defs.asm:49-56`, `diag/out.asm:706-711`):

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PASS` | The board did what the test checks |
| `FAIL` | It didn't; the line gives what was expected and what was read |
| `INFO` | A value measured, with no verdict |
| `SKIP` | The test wasn't run |
| `LOOK` | A check by eye or ear in an automatic run, for the person at the board |
| `NONE` | The device isn't fitted or doesn't answer |

## The tests

The automatic tests run in the order `diag/main.asm:56-87` calls them, which is
not the order of their numbers: T35 and T36 follow T18, and T37 follows T20. The
RAM tests T02 to T04 run before T01's line is printed, and their lines come
after it. The interactive tests run after T26 when they were chosen at the
start, or later from the report's prompt (`diag/main.asm:88-119`). Each test's
title is the text its `TBEGIN` prints:

| Test | Name | Title |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T01 | `HOME` | RAM 7E00h-7FFFh, before any stack use |
| T02 | `RAMLO` | Fixed RAM 0000h-7DFFh, 4 pattern passes |
| T03 | `RAMWIN` | Window RAM 8000h-BFFFh, EXPAND off, 4 passes |
| T04 | `RAMHOME` | RAM 7E00h-7FFFh again, 4 passes, stack in the window |
| T05 | `ROMSUM` | ROM C000h-FFFDh sums to the word at FFFEh |
| T06 | `ROMWR` | Writes to ROM are ignored |
| T07 | `OVERLAY` | Latch bit 0: ROM C000h-C7FFh appears at 0000h-07FFh |
| T08 | `OVLWR` | A write to 07FFh with the overlay on |
| T09 | `PROTECT` | Latch bit 1: 4000h-7FFFh read-only, 3FFFh writable |
| T10 | `LATCHRD` | Reading port FFh after writing it |
| T11 | `STATUS` | Port 03h for latch values 01h, 03h, 05h, 81h |
| T12 | `BANKS` | What each bank field value (latch bits 3-6) selects |
| T13 | `BANKRAM` | Each distinct bank, 8000h-BFFFh, 2 passes |
| T14 | `SERTX` | Serial TX at 4800 8N2: two known lines follow |
| T15 | `LCD` | HD44780 at 04h/84h: busy flag, DDRAM read-back |
| T16 | `GLCD` | ST7920 at 07h/87h: busy flag, graphics RAM read-back |
| T17 | `VDP` | PICO9918 at BEh/BFh: VRAM size, speed, 80 columns |
| T18 | `VDPCLK` | PICO9918 frame flag as a clock: 16 frames |
| T35 | `VDPPAGE` | PICO9918 page select: R2 07h and 0Bh |
| T36 | `F18A` | F18A identity, version and vertical scroll |
| T19 | `SD` | SD card on FDh: initialise, CSD, CID, block 0 |
| T20 | `SDBLKS` | Blocks 0-63: errors and token waits |
| T37 | `SDWRITE` | SD write on block 7, outside every volume, then restored |
| T21 | `RTC` | DS1302 on FCh (optional): time, ticking, clock check |
| T22 | `SEG7` | 7-segment: each segment, then each digit |
| T23 | `SPEAKER` | Speaker: 600, 1200 and 2400 Hz for 0.3 s each |
| T24 | `RGB8X8` | 8 x 8 matrix on 05h/06h/F8h/F9h |
| T25 | `LEDBAR` | Latch FFh on the STATUS LED bar and the CAPS lamp |
| T26 | `NMI` | NMIs during the automatic tests (none expected) |
| T27 | `SERRX` | Serial RX: typed characters come back |
| T28 | `SERBIT` | The terminal's bit time from typed U |
| T29 | `KEYPAD` | Hex keypad on 00h: every key and Shift |
| T30 | `KEYNMI` | NMIs taken for those keypad presses |
| T31 | `MATRIX` | Matrix keyboard on FEh: row and bit of each key |
| T32 | `JOY` | Joystick on FEh with A11 low |
| T33 | `CLOCK` | CPU clock by stopwatch, about 60 s |
| T34 | `SDTIME` | SD read rate by stopwatch: 256 blocks, 128 KiB |

The tests use TEC-OS's own ways of reaching the hardware where TEC-OS has them.
The serial output is bit-banged as TEC-OS's is (`diag/out.asm:1-5`), and T19's
card start is TEC-OS's SD card driver, recording each answer the card gives
(`diag/sd.asm:1-2`). T17 detects the PICO9918 as TEC-OS does and sets the
registers of TEC-OS's 80-column console (`diag/display.asm:334`,
`diag/display.asm:353`), and T35 checks the page flip that console uses
(`diag/display.asm:751`). The others measure what TEC-OS requires of the board.
T03 measures the RAM in socket U9 that holds EXPAND 0, T12 and T13 the bank
behind EXPAND 1, T07 the boot overlay that cold boot starts through and T11 the
bits of port `03h`.

Only T37 writes to the card. It writes block 7, and only on a card whose block
0 holds `TECOSVOL` (`diag/sd.asm:619-631`). No volume can use that block,
since every volume starts at a nonzero multiple of 8 blocks. T37 puts the
block back afterwards.

## The report

After the last test, `PRREP` prints the report (`diag/out.asm:737-789`), which
has a heading, a line with the version and the image ID, every result line kept
in the buffer, the totals and an end line. The ROM then prints
`R prints the report again; I runs the interactive tests.` and waits for one of
those keys (`diag/main.asm:91-106`). The model's run, from the same file, ends
with this report:

```

These answers show what the model does, not what a board does, and on several
lines they say nothing about a board. T08 says a write under the overlay reaches
the RAM underneath, T10 says port `FFh` reads back what was written to it, and
T12 says that the latch's bits 3 to 6 select nine banks. `docs/diagnostics.md`
compares each test with the TEC-1G's own documents, which describe the latch as
write-only and bits 3 to 6 as unconnected to U9, so a board can be expected to
answer T10 and T12 differently. TEC-OS uses neither. It keeps a copy of the
latch at `0040h` and never reads port `FFh` (`src/layout.asm:13`,
`src/layout.asm:36`), and it selects EXPAND 1 with bit 2 alone
(`src/layout.asm:18`).

## Running it on a board

`docs/board-run.md` lists the board's settings for a run, which are the ones
TEC-OS needs:

1. Burn `diag.rom` into both halves of a 32 KiB ROM chip, at `0000h` and
   `4000h`, so that the ROM Lo/Hi switch runs it in either position. Fit the
   chip in place of MON-3.
2. Fit a 32 KiB RAM in U9, as TEC-OS needs. Without it T03 fails, and the
   tests of EXPAND 1 have no RAM to test.
3. Set the CPU clock switch to FAST with the 4 MHz oscillator. Set the Matrix
   switch on if the matrix keyboard is fitted.
4. Connect a terminal program to the FTDI port at 4800 baud, 8 data bits, no
   parity and 2 stop bits, with its session log on.
5. Write the starter card's image to an SD card and put it in the adaptor, so
   that T19, T20 and T37 have a TEC-OS card to read. T37 writes only to a card
   whose block 0 starts with `TECOSVOL`.
6. Press reset. Press `I` on the terminal or `+` on the keypad within 5
   seconds for the interactive tests.
7. Keep off the hex keypad during the RAM tests, T09 and T25, except to answer
   a question.

The keypad's warning has the same cause as TEC-OS's. With the keypad NMI jumper
fitted, a key press makes an NMI, and the Z80 pushes its return address and
jumps to `0066h`. During the RAM tests the patterns under test overwrite the NMI
handler at `0066h`. In T09 and T25 the latch's PROTECT bit makes the stack's
page read-only, so the pushed return address is lost (`docs/diagnostics.md`, T02
and T25). TEC-OS has no NMI handler and runs with that jumper off.

The terminal's session log holds the whole run, from the banner to the last
`==== END ====`, and the report in it is the one `tools/diag-check.mjs` reads.

## Comparing a board's report

`tools/diag-check.mjs` compares the last report in a terminal's session log
with the model's run of the same image:

```sh
node tools/diag-check.mjs board-log.txt
```

It first checks that the report's image ID is the one in `build/diag/diag.rom`,
and stops with exit status 2 if it isn't (`tools/diag-check.mjs:149-153`). It
then compares each result line with the model's (`tools/diag-check.mjs:79-110`).
A line whose result and details both match is passed over, and a visual check
answered `PASS` on the board matches the model's `LOOK`.

Lines that carry measured values are compared by the form of their details,
and the board's numbers are printed beside the model's
(`tools/diag-check.mjs:31-46`). These lines include T14's bit times, T15's and
T16's busy polls, T18's frame, T19's card answers, T20's and T37's polls and
T21's clock. Every other difference is printed with the TEC-OS behaviour it
affects, taken from the last table in `docs/board-run.md`
(`tools/diag-check.mjs:64-72`). The exit status is 0 with no differences and 1
with some.
