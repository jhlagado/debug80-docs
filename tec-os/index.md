With TEC-OS in its ROM the TEC-1G starts at a command prompt. You can list
files on an SD card and run a supplied program before using the editor and
assembler to make one of your own. TEC-OS provides the CP/M 2.2 programming
interface and calls for the board's devices.

## Starting with a prepared machine

The first session uses a 40-column PICO9918 display and the matrix keyboard,
with the Matrix switch enabled. The board needs a 32,768-byte RAM chip in U9,
the 4 MHz FAST setting, the TEC-OS ROM and a prepared starter card. The keypad
non-maskable interrupt (NMI) jumper is off. SYSTEM is on drive A and WORK is on
drive B. Hardware preparation is described in
[Appendix G](appendix-g-tec-1g.md).

[First session](01-first-session.md) begins with that preparation complete.
[Make a small program](02-make-a-small-program.md)
continues with a short banner entered in TED. You save it, build it with TAS,
change its text and run it again. These two sessions introduce the keys and
commands they use without requiring an earlier CP/M or assembly course.

The banner is a guided copy-and-change exercise. Its instructions and data
are explained beside the listing. The later programming chapters assume you
can read a short Z80 listing with labels, registers and branches. They explain
the TEC-OS call, buffer and stack contracts before examples depend on them.

Serial terminals, the graphics LCD and other display widths have their own
configuration chapter. The web page is an optional way to use the software
machine, with its controls and card-saving rules in
[Appendix I](appendix-i-web-page.md).

## Runs and source

The demonstrations and measurements are from the Debug80 TEC-1G host model,
a software implementation of the machine. They are not physical-board runs.
The diagnostics chapter
separates what a test establishes in software from what a board report can
establish about that board.

Each chapter records the source revision used to check its claims. A retained
historical capture also records the revision and inputs that produced it.
Source references name the file and lines for the stated revision. A source
change may move those lines even when the assembled program is unchanged.
When the prose and its stated source disagree, the source is the authority
and the prose needs correction.

A transcript includes the prompt and the command typed after it, followed by
the output. It may begin at an already-running prompt. Any other omitted output
is identified with the example. Control keys are written with a caret: `^C`
means Ctrl and C together. Reproducing the runs on a PC requires the setup and tools in
[The host model as evidence](29-the-host-model-as-evidence.md).

Addresses and bytes use hexadecimal with a trailing `h`, as in `0100h`.
Sizes in bytes are decimal. A KiB is 1,024 bytes and a MiB is 1,024 KiB.
