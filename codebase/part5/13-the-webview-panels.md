# Chapter 13 — The Webview Panels

The webview runs in a sandboxed iframe. It has no access to the Node.js runtime, no file system, and no direct connection to the debug adapter — only a `postMessage` channel to the extension host. Within those constraints, it renders the hardware panels, handles user input, and manages the memory inspector.

This chapter covers the webview's internal architecture: the common infrastructure shared by all panels, and the platform-specific rendering and input code for TEC-1 and TEC-1G.

---

## Common infrastructure

Most cross-platform UI lives under `webview/common/`. TEC-1 and TEC-1G share **serial** wiring (`common/serial-ui.ts`), **Web Audio** speaker plumbing (`common/audio-core.ts` + thin `tec1/audio.ts` / `tec1g/tec1g-audio.ts` wrappers), the **8×8 monochrome matrix** paint path (`common/matrix-renderer.ts`; TEC-1G keeps a separate `matrix-ui.ts` for RGB, brightness, and the matrix keyboard), **seven-segment digits** (`common/seven-seg-display.ts`), and **hex keycap keypads** (`common/tec-keypad.ts` + `common/tec-keypad-layout.ts`, wrapped by `tec1g/tec1g-keypad.ts` for SysCtrl LEDs). Shared **keypad focus and shift-latch** behaviour is centralised in `common/keypad-core.ts`. Layout tokens for matrix dot size, gaps, and padding are defined once in `common/styles.css` (TEC-1G adds RGB- and platform-specific overrides). All three platform panels still share the older small utilities below.

### VS Code API bridge (`common/vscode.ts`)

```typescript
export function acquireVscodeApi(): VscodeApi {
  return acquireVsCodeApi();  // VS Code global injected into webview context
}
```

`acquireVsCodeApi()` is a global function injected by VS Code into every webview. It returns an object with three methods:

- `postMessage(msg)` — send a message to the extension host
- `getState()` — retrieve persisted state from the webview context (survives reloads)
- `setState(state)` — save state that will be restored if the webview is reloaded

The result is acquired once at module load time and passed to every component that needs to communicate outward.

### Session status controller (`common/session-status.ts`)

The Restart button sits in the tab row of every platform panel (`id="restartDebug"`). `createSessionStatusController()` manages it:

```typescript
const controller = createSessionStatusController(vscode, buttonElement);
controller.setStatus('running');
controller.setStatus('not running');
```

The button always renders with the label **Restart**. Its visual state is carried in `data-status` and CSS classes (`status-running`, `status-paused`, etc.). A click sends `{ type: 'restartDebug' }` to the extension host unless the session is still in the `'starting'` state. The button is disabled only while starting.

The status values are:

| Status | Label | Behaviour |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `'not running'` | "Restart" | Clickable |
| `'starting'` | "Restart" | Disabled |
| `'running'` | "Restart" | Clickable |
| `'paused'` | "Restart" | Clickable |

### Seven-segment display (`common/seven-seg-display.ts`)

`createSevenSegDisplay(container, count)` creates the digit column by calling the internal `createDigit()` helper for each segment polygon. The bitmask table matches the TEC-1 hardware (bit 0 = top, bit 7 = bottom). Platform `index.ts` files hold a `display` object and call `display.applyDigits(values)` on each update — they no longer hand-roll per-digit DOM loops.

### Serial I/O helpers (`common/serial.ts`)

`appendSerialText(element, text, maxLength)` appends text to a `<pre>` element and auto-scrolls to the bottom. If the total length would exceed `maxLength`, the oldest text is trimmed from the front. This prevents the serial display from growing without bound.

### Project status UI (`common/project-status-ui.ts`)

`createProjectStatusUi(vscode, elements, platform)` wires up the project header for a platform panel: it handles `projectStatus` messages, populates the Target dropdown, sets the Platform selector value, shows or hides controls via `applyInitializedProjectControls()`, and wires the Initialize button, target change handler, and stop-on-entry checkbox. This function consolidates the setup-card/target-dropdown/project-root wiring that was previously duplicated across `simple/index.ts`, `tec1/index.ts`, and `tec1g/tec1g-project-status-ui.ts`. All three platform panels now call `createProjectStatusUi()` from this shared module.

`webview/tec1g/tec1g-project-status-ui.ts` re-exports from `webview/common/project-status-ui.ts` for backward compatibility rather than containing the implementation itself.

### Create project helper (`common/create-project.ts`)

`sendCreateProject(vscode, platform)` posts the `{ type: 'createProject', platform }` message to the extension host. It is used by all three platform webviews when the user clicks the Initialize button, replacing the copy-pasted `vscode.postMessage` calls that previously appeared in each platform's own entry point.

---

## Webview file structure

Each platform has its own directory under `webview/`. The tree below lists the main modules (not every asset):

```
webview/
  common/           Shared utilities and styles
    audio-core.ts       Shared Web Audio oscillator/gain (used by tec1 + tec1g audio wrappers)
    create-project.ts   sendCreateProject()
    digits.ts           Internal helpers for seven-seg-display
    matrix-renderer.ts  Monochrome 8×8 matrix paint (TEC-1; TEC-1G RGB is separate)
    memory-panel.ts
    project-status-ui.ts
    serial-ui.ts        wireSerialUi() — TEC-1 and TEC-1G serial terminal wiring
    serial.ts
    session-status.ts
    seven-seg-display.ts
    tec-keypad.ts       Keycap button builder + tec-keypad-layout.ts
    tec-keypad-layout.ts
    keypad-core.ts      tabIndex, container/key focus, shift latch for hex keypads
    vscode.ts
    styles.css          Shared TEC + matrix grid tokens; TEC-1G breakpoint tweaks in tec1g/styles.css
  simple/
    index.html, index.ts, styles.css
  tec1/
    index.html, index.ts, panel-layout.ts, lcd-renderer.ts, audio.ts, styles.css
  tec1g/
    index.html, index.ts, entry-types.ts, tec1g-platform-update.ts, tec1g-tab-memory.ts
    tec1g-audio.ts, tec1g-keypad.ts, tec1g-memory-views.ts, matrix-ui.ts
    visibility-controller.ts, glcd-renderer.ts, lcd-renderer.ts, hd44780-a00.ts
    st7920-font.bin, styles.css
```

The **TEC-1** `index.ts` is still a single entry file but delegates display, keypad, and serial to the shared modules above. The **TEC-1G** `index.ts` remains a thin composition root.

The TEC-1 `index.ts` is a self-contained entry point that acquires the VS Code API, queries the DOM, wires up event listeners, creates rendering components, and installs the `window.message` handler. The TEC-1G `index.ts` is a thin composition root — it imports all the feature modules, queries the DOM once, and wires them together. All TEC-1G platform logic lives in the feature modules, not in `index.ts`.

`entry-types.ts` exists to break circular imports. The feature modules (`tec1g-audio.ts`, `tec1g-keypad.ts`, `matrix-ui.ts`, etc.) all need to refer to the same `IncomingMessage`, `Tec1gUpdatePayload`, `Tec1gPanelTab`, and `Tec1gSpeedMode` types. If each module defined its own copy, or if modules imported types from each other, the import graph would become tangled. Instead, all shared types are defined once in `entry-types.ts` and every module that needs them imports from there. `index.ts` imports from both `entry-types.ts` and the feature modules; the feature modules import only from `entry-types.ts` (not from `index.ts`), keeping the dependency graph acyclic.

---

## HTML template structure

All three `index.html` files follow the same structure:

```html
<div class="project-header">
  <div class="project-control">                          <!-- always visible -->
    <span class="project-label">Project</span>
    <button id="selectProject">No workspace roots available</button>
    <button id="addWorkspaceFolder" title="Add folder to workspace">+</button>
  </div>
  <div class="project-control">                          <!-- visible only when initialized -->
    <span class="project-label">Target</span>
    <select id="homeTargetSelect"></select>
  </div>
  <div class="project-control" hidden>                   <!-- visible only when uninitialized -->
    <span class="project-label">Platform</span>
    <select id="platformSelect">
      <option value="simple">Simple</option>
      <option value="tec1">TEC-1</option>
      <option value="tec1g">TEC-1G</option>
    </select>
  </div>
    <button id="platformInitButton">Initialize</button>
  </div>
  <div class="project-control" id="platformInfoControl" hidden>  <!-- currently kept hidden -->
    <span class="project-label">Platform</span>
    <span id="platformValue"></span>
  </div>
  <label class="stop-on-entry-label" hidden>             <!-- visible only when initialized -->
    <input type="checkbox" id="stopOnEntry" />
    Stop on entry
  </label>
</div>
<div class="setup-card" id="setupCard">
  <div id="setupCardText">...</div>
  <button id="setupPrimaryAction">...</button>
</div>
<div class="tabs">
  <div class="tabs-buttons">
    <button class="tab" data-tab="ui">UI</button>
    <button class="tab" data-tab="memory">CPU</button>
  </div>
  <div class="tabs-status-slot">
    <button class="session-status" id="restartDebug">Restart</button>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="panel panel-ui" id="panel-ui"> ... platform UI content ... </div>
<div class="panel panel-memory" id="panel-memory"> ... registers + memory ... </div>
```

The `project-header` occupies the top of the panel whenever there is a workspace context to act on. In the special `noWorkspace` state it is hidden entirely, leaving only the empty-state card visible. The `setup-card` is shown when the workspace is not fully configured and hidden once a project exists. The `tabs` row sits below the setup card and is hidden until the project is initialized.

Only one `panel` div is active at a time; CSS classes control visibility.

---

## The project header

The project header renders the current workspace context and lets the user change it without leaving the panel. It is always visible at the top of the panel, regardless of project state or which tab is active. Individual controls within it are shown or hidden by `applyInitializedProjectControls()` depending on `projectState`.

**Project button** — always visible whenever the header is visible. Shows the selected workspace folder name (or a placeholder when no folder is selected). Clicking it sends `{ type: 'selectProject', rootPath }`, triggering workspace selection.

**Add folder button** (`+`) — always visible, next to the root button. Clicking it sends `{ type: 'openWorkspaceFolder' }`, which runs the VS Code command to add a new folder to the workspace. This button is always present so the user can add workspace folders from any state without needing to navigate away from the panel.

**Target selector** — visible only when `projectState === 'initialized'`. A `<select>` populated from the `targets[]` array in the `projectStatus` message. When the user picks a target, the webview sends `{ type: 'selectTarget', rootPath, targetName }`.

**Platform selector** — visible only when `projectState === 'uninitialized'`. A `<select>` with three fixed options: Simple, TEC-1, TEC-1G. Its value is set from `projectStatus.platform` on each `projectStatus` message. In the current panel redesign it shares the row with an inline **Initialize** button (`platformInitButton`), so project creation can happen directly from the platform row instead of from a duplicate card button.

**Platform info row** — the old read-only `platformInfoControl` slot still exists in the DOM, but the current UI contract keeps it hidden. That avoids rendering a second platform control in initialized state.

**Stop on entry** — visible only when `projectState === 'initialized'`. A checkbox in the project header row that toggles the global stop-on-entry flag for the current VS Code window session. When toggled, the webview sends `{ type: 'setStopOnEntry', stopOnEntry: boolean }`. The value is not persisted into `debug80.json`.

When a `projectStatus` message arrives:

1. The project button text is updated to show the current root name.
2. The target `<select>` is repopulated with options from `targets[]` and the current target is pre-selected.
3. The platform `<select>` value is set from `platform`.
4. `applyInitializedProjectControls()` shows or hides each control row.
5. The stop-on-entry checkbox value is set from `message.stopOnEntry`.

### `projectIsInitialized` guard

Each panel's `index.ts` tracks a module-level `let projectIsInitialized = false` boolean. It is set to `true` after the first `projectStatus` message that resolves to `'initialized'`. The platform `<select>` change handler is wrapped in `if (projectIsInitialized)` — this prevents a spurious `saveProjectConfig` message from firing when the platform value is programmatically set during panel initialization or rehydration, before a real project exists. Without this guard, the change event would trigger on the initial value assignment and cause the extension host to re-render the view unexpectedly.

## The setup card

Below the project header, a setup card handles the not-yet-configured states:

- **No workspace roots** → displays an empty-state message and an **Open Folder** action. The header itself is hidden in this state.
- **Workspace available but no selected root** → displays a **Select Project** action.
- **Selected root but no initialized debug80 project** → displays **Uninitialized Debug80 project**. In the current panel redesign the setup card hides its own button for the create-project case, because the active create action lives in the inline `platformInitButton` on the platform row.
- **Project exists** → the card is **hidden entirely**.

The setup card state is recalculated on every `projectStatus` message by `resolveSetupCardState()` in `webview/common/setup-card-state.ts`, which returns `null` when a project exists (causing the card to be hidden).

---

## Tab switching

`createPanelLayoutController()` in `webview/tec1/panel-layout.ts` manages tab state for the TEC-1 panel. The TEC-1G equivalent is `createTec1gTabMemory()` in `webview/tec1g/tec1g-tab-memory.ts`.

`setTab(tab, notify)`:
- Applies the `active` CSS class to the selected tab button.
- Applies the `active` CSS class to the matching panel div.
- If `notify` is true, posts `{ type: 'tab', tab }` to the extension host so the provider can update the active tab and adjust memory polling.
- If switching to the memory tab, immediately requests a memory snapshot.

`updateMemoryLayout(forceRefresh)`:
- Called on window resize.
- Chooses 8 or 16 bytes per row based on panel width (breakpoint at ~500px).
- If the row size changed, requests a new snapshot.

---

## The TEC-1 panel

### UI tab

**Display.** Six `createDigit()` elements are appended to `#display`. Each update message replaces their values via `updateDigit()`.

**Keypad.** Built dynamically in `index.ts`. The layout is:

```
RST  [spacers]
AD   F E D C
GO   B A 9 8
UP   7 6 5 4
DOWN 3 2 1 0
SHIFT
```

`AD`/`GO` and the two directional keys map to 0x13, 0x12, 0x10, 0x11. The same `tec-keypad-layout` tokens are used for both platforms: on the **TEC-1G** panel the keycaps are **◀** (left) and **▶** (right); on **TEC-1** hardware the physical switches are often labeled **UP**/**DOWN** but the webview uses the same chevron keycaps. Hex digits 0–F map to 0x00–0x0F. **Shift** (physical or on-screen) acts as a momentary **FN** modifier; additional shortcuts include **Tab→AD/ADDRESS**, **Space→0**, **Enter→GO**, and **Escape→Reset** (aligning with the TEC-1G map). The keypad `div` is focusable (`tabIndex=0`); key routing runs only while the keypad has focus, and a `mousedown` handler on the UI panel (excluding native form controls) re-focuses the keypad so clicking the emulated front panel does not leave keyboard input targeting the parent document. See the **debug80** repository `src/platforms/tec1/README.md` and `src/platforms/tec1g/README.md` for the panel keyboard shortcut tables.

Each key click or keydown sends `{ type: 'key', code: number }` to the extension host.

**Speaker.** An indicator element shows "SPEAKER ON" when `speaker` is true. The `speakerHz` label shows the last measured frequency. The mute button toggles the Web Audio API tone without telling the adapter — muting is a local webview preference.

**Speed.** A SLOW/FAST toggle button. Clicking sends `{ type: 'speed', mode: 'slow' | 'fast' }`.

**LCD.** A 224×40 pixel `<canvas>` rendered by `createLcdRenderer()`. Characters are drawn using a monospace font at 14×20 pixels each. Background colour: dark green (#0b1a10). Character colour: bright green (#b4f5b4). The `lcdByteToChar()` function maps byte values to display characters, substituting a few special HD44780 characters (¥, ▶, ◀).

**LED matrix.** An 8×8 grid of `<div>` elements. Each row byte has 8 bits; bit 0 is column 0. A set bit adds the `on` CSS class to the corresponding dot element.

**Serial.** A `<pre>` element for output and a text input for sending. The input field appends a CR on Enter. Buttons: FILE (send file), SAVE (save buffer), CLEAR.

### Memory tab

Four independent memory view sections (a, b, c, d). Each has:

- A `<select>` for the view mode (PC, SP, HL, BC, DE, IX, IY, or Absolute)
- An address label and optional symbol label
- An optional text input for absolute address
- A hex/ASCII dump area

The memory panel is managed by `MemoryPanel` in `webview/common/memory-panel.ts`. It handles snapshot messages, renders hex bytes with ASCII equivalents, highlights the current address, and supports in-place editing.

When the user edits a byte in the memory dump, the panel sends `{ type: 'memoryEdit', address, value }`. When the user edits a register in the register strip, it sends `{ type: 'registerEdit', register, value }`.

### Web Audio speaker

`createAudioController()` in `webview/tec1/audio.ts` uses the Web Audio API to generate a square wave tone at the `speakerHz` frequency. When the speaker is active:

1. An `OscillatorNode` is created at the given frequency.
2. A `GainNode` applies a gentle ramp-up to avoid clicks.
3. The oscillator connects through the gain to the audio context destination.

When `speakerHz` drops to 0 or the mute button is pressed, the gain ramps down and the oscillator is disconnected. The mute state is local to the webview — it is not communicated to the adapter.

---

## The TEC-1G panel

The TEC-1G panel uses a modular structure. `index.ts` is a thin composition root that imports all feature modules, queries DOM elements, and wires them together. It installs a single `window.addEventListener('message', ...)` dispatcher that delegates to the appropriate module.

### TEC-1G webview module layout

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `index.ts` | Composition root — DOM queries, module wiring, message dispatcher; calls `visibilityController.setProjectTargetName(message.targetName)` on each `projectStatus` |
| `entry-types.ts` | Shared types: `IncomingMessage`, `Tec1gUpdatePayload`, `Tec1gPanelTab`, `Tec1gSpeedMode` |
| `tec1g-platform-update.ts` | `applyTec1gPlatformUpdate()` — applies a hardware update payload to all display components |
| `tec1g-project-status-ui.ts` | Re-exports `createProjectStatusUi` from `webview/common/project-status-ui.ts` |
| `tec1g-tab-memory.ts` | `createTec1gTabMemory()` — tab switching, active-tab tracking, memory row sizing |
| `tec1g-audio.ts` | `createTec1gAudio()` — wraps `common/audio-core.ts`, mute and UI |
| `tec1g-keypad.ts` | `createTec1gKeypad()` — `common/tec-keypad` + `keypad-core` + status LEDs / SysCtrl |
| `tec1g-memory-views.ts` | `createTec1gMemoryViews()` — memory view section factory |
| `visibility-controller.ts` | `createVisibilityController()` — section show/hide, `getState` cache, and `saveTec1gPanelVisibility` posts |
| `matrix-ui.ts` | `createMatrixUiController()` — RGB LED matrix display and matrix keyboard input |
| `glcd-renderer.ts` | `createGlcdRenderer()` — ST7920 128×64 GLCD canvas renderer |
| `lcd-renderer.ts` | `createLcdRenderer()` — HD44780 20×4 text LCD canvas renderer with CGRAM |
| `hd44780-a00.ts` | HD44780 A00 ROM character table |
| `../common/tec-keypad-layout.ts` | `TEC1G_DIGITS`, `TEC1G_KEY_MAP` (imported by TEC-1G keypad) |
| `../common/serial-ui.ts` | `wireSerialUi()` — used via `index.ts` (no separate `tec1g/serial-ui.ts` file) |
| `st7920-font.bin` | ST7920 GLCD font (static asset) |

**Layout (UI tab).** The left column stacks **text LCD → 7-segment → hex keypad** (full front panel). The right column has speed / mute / speaker / status LEDs, then **GLCD**, then the **RGB 8×8** matrix. Serial + matrix **keyboard** strip sits full width below. Checkbox order in the template follows that visual order. Container breakpoints and column widths were tuned for the wider GLCD + matrix column (~620px two-column layout).

### Visibility controller

`createVisibilityController()` in `webview/tec1g/visibility-controller.ts` manages which UI sections are visible. Sections are identified by name (e.g., `'display'`, `'lcd'`, `'glcd'`, `'matrix'`, `'keypad'`). Defaults are shared with the extension through `src/tec1g/visibility-defaults.ts` (`TEC1G_DEFAULT_PANEL_VISIBILITY`).

**Persistence** is two-layered:

1. **Workspace `Memento`** (extension host) — on every checkbox change, the webview posts `{ type: 'saveTec1gPanelVisibility', targetName?, visibility }`. The provider stores a **per debug-target** object under `debug80.tec1g.uiVisibilityByTarget` (target name from the latest `projectStatus`, or a `__default__` key when none is named). The effective visibility for the active target is **merged** in the host as: defaults → `tec1g.uiVisibility` from the current launch (if any) → Memento, then sent back as a `uiVisibility` message with `persist: true` after re-renders that need it. This prevents the old behaviour where a **stale launch-only** snapshot was re-posted after HTML reload and overwrote the user's choices.
2. **`vscode.getState` / `setState`** (webview) — still updated so the current session can recover quickly before host messages arrive.

`tec1g.uiVisibility` in `debug80.json` therefore supplies **project defaults**; personal layout choices can live entirely in workspace state per target.

### RGB LED matrix (`matrix-ui.ts`)

`createMatrixUiController()` in `webview/tec1g/matrix-ui.ts` manages both the LED display and the matrix keyboard input.

**LED rendering.** The matrix is rendered as 64 `<div>` elements in an 8×8 grid. Each element receives inline `background-color` styling based on the R, G, B brightness values from the update payload:

```typescript
function applyMatrixBrightness(
  dots: HTMLElement[],
  r: number[], g: number[], b: number[]
): void {
  dots.forEach((dot, idx) => {
    const rv = r[idx] ?? 0;
    const gv = g[idx] ?? 0;
    const bv = b[idx] ?? 0;
    dot.style.backgroundColor =
      `rgb(${rv}, ${gv}, ${bv})`;
  });
}
```

The 64-entry brightness arrays (one per channel) come from the `matrixBrightnessR/G/B` fields of the TEC-1G update message. Each value is 0–255.

**Matrix keyboard input.** When matrix mode is enabled, the LED matrix area also acts as a clickable keyboard. Each dot element gets a click listener that sends:

```typescript
{ type: 'matrixKey', key: string, pressed: boolean, shift: boolean, ctrl: boolean, alt: boolean }
```

The `key` field encodes the row and column. Physical keyboard events are captured globally when matrix mode is active and translated to the same message format.

`createMatrixUiController()` also handles the matrix mode toggle button, which sends `{ type: 'matrixMode', enabled: boolean }`.

### Platform update application (`tec1g-platform-update.ts`)

`applyTec1gPlatformUpdate()` receives a `Tec1gUpdatePayload` and dispatches it to the individual rendering components: digit elements, audio controller, speed indicator, LCD renderer, matrix UI, GLCD renderer, and keypad state indicators. This function is the single point of contact between an arriving `update` message and all the display components.

### GLCD renderer (`glcd-renderer.ts`)

`createGlcdRenderer()` renders the ST7920 128×64 monochrome display onto a `<canvas>` element.

The GDRAM is a 1024-byte array: 64 rows, 16 bytes per row (128 pixels at 1 bit per pixel). The renderer reads each bit and sets the corresponding canvas pixel:

```typescript
function renderGdram(ctx, gdram, displayOn, graphicsOn, width, height): void {
  if (!displayOn || !graphicsOn) {
    ctx.fillStyle = '#a8b865';
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);
    return;
  }
  const imageData = ctx.createImageData(width, height);
  for (let row = 0; row < 64; row++) {
    for (let byteIdx = 0; byteIdx < 16; byteIdx++) {
      const byte = gdram[row * 16 + byteIdx] ?? 0;
      for (let bit = 7; bit >= 0; bit--) {
        const col = byteIdx * 8 + (7 - bit);
        const on = Boolean(byte & (1 << bit));
        const pixelIdx = (row * width + col) * 4;
        // RGBA: dark pixels on bright background
        imageData.data[pixelIdx]     = on ? 0x1a : 0xa8;
        imageData.data[pixelIdx + 1] = on ? 0x28 : 0xb8;
        imageData.data[pixelIdx + 2] = on ? 0x05 : 0x65;
        imageData.data[pixelIdx + 3] = 255;
      }
    }
  }
  ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
}
```

The colour scheme is a green-tinted LCD look: dark pixels on a light green background.

The renderer also handles text mode (DDRAM rendering with the ST7920 font) and cursor blink, though these are secondary to the graphics mode.

### Text LCD renderer (`tec1g/lcd-renderer.ts`)

The TEC-1G's text LCD is larger and more capable than the TEC-1's — four rows of twenty characters, with CGRAM support for custom characters.

The renderer in `webview/tec1g/lcd-renderer.ts` uses the HD44780 A00 character ROM defined in `hd44780-a00.ts`. This module exports a complete mapping from character codes 0x00–0xFF to rendered bitmaps. Custom characters (codes 0x00–0x07) are drawn from the CGRAM array when it is present.

Each character is rendered into a small off-screen canvas (5×8 pixels scaled up) and composited into the main canvas. The CGRAM support means custom characters defined by the running program are correctly displayed — if the program loads a custom character set, it appears in the webview.

---

## The message handler

The TEC-1 `index.ts` installs a single `window.addEventListener('message', handler)`. The TEC-1G `index.ts` does the same, dispatching on `event.data.type`:

```typescript
window.addEventListener('message', (event: MessageEvent<IncomingMessage | undefined>): void => {
  const message = event.data;
  if (!message) return;
  if (message.type === 'projectStatus') { visibilityController.setProjectTargetName(message.targetName); projectStatusUi.applyProjectStatus(message); return; }
  if (message.type === 'sessionStatus') { sessionStatusController.setStatus(message.status); return; }
  if (message.type === 'selectTab')     { tabMemory.setTab(message.tab, false); return; }
  if (message.type === 'uiVisibility')  { visibilityController.applyOverride(message.visibility, ...); return; }
  if (message.type === 'update') {
    if (typeof message.uiRevision === 'number') {
      if (message.uiRevision < uiRevision) return;  // stale
      uiRevision = message.uiRevision;
    }
    applyUpdateFromPayload(message);
    if (tabMemory.getActiveTab() === 'memory') memoryPanelController?.requestSnapshot();
    return;
  }
  if (message.type === 'snapshot')      { memoryPanelController?.handleSnapshot(message); return; }
  if (message.type === 'snapshotError') { memoryPanelController?.handleSnapshotError(message.message); }
});
```

The `uiRevision` guard is applied to `update` messages. Other message types do not need it — project status, session status, and serial messages are always current when they arrive.

## The Simple platform panel

The simple platform panel (`webview/simple/`) is a self-contained entry point in `index.ts`. It shares the same project header, setup card, session status button, and CPU/memory tab as the hardware platforms, but its UI tab contains a terminal display instead of hardware emulation.

### UI tab

The UI tab contains a single **TERMINAL** section:

- A `<pre id="terminalOut">` element accumulates text output received from the running program via the Z80 terminal I/O bridge (`debug80/terminalOutput` events, routed to the sidebar for simple sessions).
- A **CLEAR** button clears the display locally and sends `{ type: 'serialClear' }` to the extension host, which clears the server-side buffer.

The `serial`, `serialInit`, and `serialClear` message types used by the hardware platform serial terminals are reused for the simple platform's terminal output. On rehydration, the accumulated terminal text is replayed via `serialInit`.

### CPU tab

Identical to the TEC-1 and TEC-1G CPU tabs — four independent memory view sections, register strip, inline editing. Uses the same `MemoryPanel` from `webview/common/memory-panel.ts`.

### Tab switching

Tab state is tracked locally and reported to the extension host via `{ type: 'tab', tab }` so the provider can control memory refresh polling. The default tab on session start is `'ui'`.

---

## The memory inspector

`MemoryPanel` in `webview/common/memory-panel.ts` (435 lines) manages the CPU/memory tab. It handles up to four independent memory view sections.

### Snapshot request

When the memory tab is active, the panel calls `requestSnapshot()` periodically (or when a new `update` arrives from the adapter). This sends:

```typescript
{ type: 'refresh', views: [{ mode, address }, ...] }
```

The extension host forwards this to `debug80/tec1MemorySnapshot` (or `debug80/tec1gMemorySnapshot`). The adapter reads the requested memory regions and returns a snapshot that includes registers, stack, and the requested byte arrays.

### Snapshot rendering

When a `snapshot` message arrives, the panel:

1. Renders the register strip — all Z80 registers formatted as hex values. The PC register is highlighted to show the current instruction address.
2. For each of the four memory views, renders a hex dump of the returned bytes. Bytes are displayed 8 or 16 per row (depending on panel width). Each row shows the hex values and their ASCII equivalents.
3. The symbol name for the current PC is shown above its view section.

### Inline editing

Clicking a hex byte in the memory dump opens an in-place edit field. Entering a new value sends `{ type: 'memoryEdit', address, value }`. Clicking a register in the register strip opens a similar edit field and sends `{ type: 'registerEdit', register, value }`.

The edit field accepts hex input without a `0x` prefix. Input is validated before sending — non-hex characters and out-of-range values are rejected.

## Summary

- The webview is sandboxed JavaScript with access only to the VS Code postMessage channel. All communication with the adapter is mediated by the extension host.

- Common infrastructure (`vscode.ts`, `session-status.ts`, `digits.ts`, `serial.ts`, `memory-panel.ts`) is shared by all three platform panels.

- Every platform panel has the same outer shell: project header (Project button + `+` button, Target dropdown, Platform dropdown, Stop-on-entry checkbox), setup card, tab bar with Restart button, UI tab panel, and CPU/memory tab panel.

- The **project header** is always visible. The `+` (Add folder) button is always present. The Target dropdown and Stop-on-entry checkbox are shown only when `projectState === 'initialized'`. The Platform dropdown is shown only when `projectState === 'uninitialized'` so the user can choose a platform before initializing — once a project exists it is hidden.

- Each panel's `index.ts` maintains `let projectIsInitialized = false`. The platform `<select>` change handler only fires `saveProjectConfig` when `projectIsInitialized === true`, preventing spurious config writes during panel initialization.

- The **setup card** is shown when the workspace is not yet configured and hidden entirely once a project exists. There is no intermediate "configured" state.

- The **Simple platform** UI tab displays a TERMINAL output area driven by `debug80/terminalOutput` events. It has no hardware display. Its CPU tab is identical to TEC-1/TEC-1G.

- The **TEC-1** panel renders six SVG seven-segment digits, an 8×8 LED matrix, a 16×2 HD44780 canvas LCD, a hex keypad (shared `tec-keypad` + `keypad-core`), a speaker indicator with Web Audio output, and a serial terminal (`common/serial-ui`). Entry logic lives in `tec1/index.ts` with shared helpers from `webview/common/`.

- The **TEC-1G** `index.ts` is a thin composition root. Feature logic is split across dedicated modules. The RGB LED matrix with per-pixel brightness, 128×64 ST7920 GLCD, 20×4 HD44780 LCD with CGRAM, and matrix keyboard mode are each handled by their dedicated module. **Section visibility** merges defaults, launch `tec1g.uiVisibility`, and **per-target workspace Memento**, and posts `saveTec1gPanelVisibility` when the user toggles checkboxes.

- The `uiRevision` guard in the message handler rejects stale `update` messages from previous sessions.

- The memory inspector polls the adapter at 150 ms intervals when visible, renders register and memory snapshots, and supports inline hex editing of registers and memory bytes.
