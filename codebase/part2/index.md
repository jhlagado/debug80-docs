# Part II — The Debug Adapter

Part II explains how debug80 implements the Debug Adapter Protocol and manages the lifecycle of a debug session. You will learn how DAP requests arrive and are handled, how session state is structured, how the launch pipeline builds a running Z80 environment from a configuration file, and how the execution loop runs the emulator between breakpoints.
